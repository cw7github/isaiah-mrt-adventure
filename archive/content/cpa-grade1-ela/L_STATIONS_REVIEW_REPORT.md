## Issues Found

### ❌ Major Issues: 0
No critical errors found in content, structure, or alignment.

### ⚠️ Minor Issues: 0
No minor issues requiring attention.

### Observations (Not Issues):
1. **l_g3_plurals_verbs** and **l_g5_verb_tense** have only 1 instructional page each, compared to 2-4 for other stations. This is acceptable as the concepts are more focused.

2. Some stations use the same instructional content twice (e.g., l_g10_spelling_strategies pages 3-4). This appears intentional for reinforcement.

3. All read pages use the "sentence" field rather than "content" field - this is a design choice for this station type and is implemented consistently.

---

## Recommendations

### For Continued Excellence
✅ **No edits needed** - all stations are well-designed and ready for use

### Optional Enhancements (Future Development)
1. **Add Challenge Questions:** For advanced learners, consider adding 1-2 extension questions per station
2. **Diversify Examples:** While current examples are excellent, adding more cultural diversity in names and contexts could enhance inclusivity
3. **Audio Support:** Consider adding audio for read-aloud passages (not currently in spec but valuable for early readers)
4. **Progress Tracking:** Current design includes checklistTargets - ensure these link to a progress dashboard
