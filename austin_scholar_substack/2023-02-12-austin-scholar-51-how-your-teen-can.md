### **Hey, y'all!**

Instead of doing a separate update, anecdote, and article for this week's newsletter, this week I'm combining all three. I have a lot to share with you, and I'm excited to dive in.

A few weeks ago, I got a request from one of my subscribers to write a newsletter on the book *[Outsmart Your Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Outsmart-Your-Brain-Learning-Hard/dp/1982167173)*–so that’s what I’m doing this week. This book is mainly targeted toward educators and instructors, so I translated some of the concepts for parents to make them teen-friendly.

If anyone else has a request for a newsletter, send it over! I had such a fun time writing this one and I would love to answer any other questions y’all might have.

### How Your Teen Can Outsmart Their Brain

*Outsmart Your Brain* covers a lot of ground – everything from test prep and notetaking to managing self-confidence. I chose a few of the topics most applicable to teenagers (and I’ll be honest, most interesting to me) to write about here.

In this article, I’m covering:

1. How to work through anxiety and self-confidence
2. How to plan your work, defeat procrastination, and stay focused
3. How to study for exams

I personally found all these tips extremely helpful and plan to implement the ones I’m not already using into my own work, so this might be a good newsletter to forward directly to your teen.

## **How to work through anxiety and self-confidence**

So many kids struggle with anxiety and a lack of self-confidence in school.

Like me, for example. This week, I got stuck in a devastating anxiety loop where I had extreme thoughts of how behind I was, how I was going to fail, and how everyone was going to be disappointed in me.

The thoughts paralyzed me so much that I couldn’t start doing any schoolwork, which led to me being more and more frustrated and behind.

I spent the entire week unable to make progress on my goals.

The last few chapters of *Outsmart Your Brain* focus on these topics of anxiety and self-confidence, and obviously, I resonated with them a lot.

Here were a few of the core points:

1. **Anxiety has a lot of physical effects**

When you’re anxious, you can feel your muscles tense, your body get sweaty, and your heart rate speeds up.

(I experienced these effects this past week. I barely got any sleep because I felt so sick from the anxiety.)

Your body does this because it thinks you’re in danger.

That’s what anxiety is: a stress response to protect you from threats in the outside world. But, most of the time our bodies are panicking about things that aren't actually that dangerous, and the stress response is just your body on overdrive. To help your kid through this, teach them mindfulness exercises.

These will ground your kid so they can calm down their fight-or-flight response and come back to the real world.

2. **Calm the anxiety by reframing your thoughts**

After the physical effects are dealt with, the next issue is the thoughts themselves.

So many kids get caught in cycles of catastrophizing or black-and-white thinking (which I have already written [an entire article on how to avoid](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-34-the-science-of)).

Basically, you have to teach kids to take a step back and reframe everything that’s going on around them. There are nuances in life that they don’t fully understand–or just can’t wrap their minds around when they’re in an anxiety spiral.

The overall idea is that your kid has to accept the anxiety, then try to reframe and work through it.

And as preventative measures for anxiety, you can help your kid gain self-confidence in themselves and as a learner. For example, if they’re prone to anxiety about school, acknowledge their successes and be proud of their progress, not just their grades.

Work with your kid to self-identify what academic concepts they do well in, and what they need more work in. Then, find ways to support them in the things that are most challenging.

## **How to plan your work, defeat procrastination, and stay focused**

In general, our brains aren’t good at allocating enough time to complete scheduled work, and we’re also good at forgetting when we have work planned.

To fix this, you need to establish a small set of simple habits, so you know what work you’re expected to complete, and by when.

The main reason I wasn’t productive this week is that I completely disrupted my schedule.

Completely.

I couldn’t fall asleep, so I woke up at the wrong time. I got to school really late and wasn’t able to complete my normal study blocks, which meant it was really hard to get work done.

Normally, I have a really clear schedule, with all of my day time-blocked. When I’m getting ready for the day, driving to school, studying, taking breaks, eating lunch… it’s all meticulously mapped out.

I wasn’t able to get any work done because I fell off my schedule, which shows how impactful this planning thing can be.

*Outsmart Your Brain* has a few big tips:

1. **Get enough sleep**

Sleep loss makes it harder to think and to pay attention. It also [disrupts what you’ve learned the previous day.](https://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/benefits-of-sleep/learning-memory#:~:text=When%20we%20are%20sleep%20deprived,to%20access%20previously%20learned%20information.)

But as I also know, it can be really hard to fall asleep. So, how do you ensure you get sleep consistently?

* Have a consistent pre-bed routine (I didn’t do that at all this week–I felt so horrible that I decided to skip the journaling and skin care and just fall into bed.)
* Use common sense and pick a good time to go to bed, then be consistent with it
* Take a nap (If you want to learn more on taking naps, [I wrote an entire newsletter on it](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-10-let-teenagers-take)!)

2. **Do deep work and have productive study sessions**

To be consistent as a student, you need to plan a block of time every day for learning. Treat it as an appointment. This is the time when you work through your to-do list and dive into learning and studying.

Here’s how you make a good to-do list:

* The first item on the to-do list is always “write today’s to-do list”
* Look at yesterday’s to-do list and add unfinished items to today’s list
* Scan your to-do list and rank by priority
* Each to-do list item should take between 20-60 minutes to complete. If something is bigger than that, it should get divided into smaller pieces.

3. **Create a calendar**

Calendars are crucial to staying productive and on-task, without missing any assignment deadlines or important appointments:

* Use a calendar that you have on you *at all times*
* Add anything to your calendar–learning blocks, meetings, and break times
* Write down deadlines as soon as you get them
* Put your social events in your calendar too, so you won’t be surprised when you suddenly have work to do *and* have to go to dinner

Of course, there are going to be times when you want to procrastinate and just *don’t* want to do an assignment.

Create goals that are your north stars, that align with everything you want to do.

For example, my goal is to get into Oxford, and everything else I do aligns with that. Whenever I think about procrastinating, or ask “what should I do,” I can come back to my main goal: I want to get into Oxford, so I should do the things that most help me accomplish that.

And, of course, distractions are inevitable. When you’re distracted, the best thing you can do is change your surroundings or your environment.

Your environment includes everything from where you’re sitting, to what objects are around you, to what you’re wearing, to what’s on your phone. Change one of those, and the pattern interrupt will help you get you back on track.

## **How to study for exams**

I speak from first-hand experience when I say that teenagers choose their memorization techniques based on what seems easy and what *seems* to yield success–even when it doesn’t.

When I used to study for my AP exams, I used strategies that were really bad–things like repeating information, re-reading the textbook, highlighting my notes, or going through flashcards. They *felt* productive. But those are not effective strategies and lead to a lot of wasted time.

Basically, what you *should* be doing is thinking about meaning (reasons to remember the content) and organizing your material accordingly. Even though that feels difficult and less productive in the short term, in the long term learning via meaning leads to much higher returns.

Here are a few tips for your kid that *Outsmart Your Brain* provides:

* Think about the concepts like you’re telling a story–connect pieces together.
* When you’re thinking about a test, ask yourself about both the content in the test *and* the types of questions that will be asked.
* When you make a study guide, make it as complete as possible. Don’t have extra random things (like a note saved elsewhere). It needs to be in your study guide or you’re going to forget it.
* A good way to add context to your notes is to add meaning by asking “why” or “how.”
* Mnemonics are memory tricks that help you learn something meaningless (that you can’t add context to).
* When you study with other people, quiz one another verbally. You’ll each have slightly different perspectives, which will further aid your memory.
* If you can test your knowledge without any other support to your performance, you’ll know you’re ready for an exam.

*“Being ready for a test means being able to explain content yourself, not just understanding it when someone else explains it.” – Outsmart Your Brain*

These aren’t just tips I’m repeating from the book–I’m actually using them to study for AP’s this year, too.

I’m creating a *super* comprehensive personal study guide, then using learning sciences (like spaced repetition and elaboration) to ensure I actually learn what’s in the study guide, and then connecting concepts to personal experiences so I master them.
