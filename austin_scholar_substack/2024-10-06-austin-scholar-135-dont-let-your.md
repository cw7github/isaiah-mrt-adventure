### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How a group of middle schoolers transformed their math journeys by beating high schoolers
2. Don’t let your kid struggle with self-confidence (& tips on how to help your kid become successful)
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

It feels as though a thousand years have passed since I wrote last week. Life at Stanford moves so quickly and I’m doing my best to make the most of every day. From hours of classes every day, to the pages and pages of reading due for my classes, to ensuring I’m making friends and socializing, to staying active, to joining and participating in clubs and events, to talking to my family and friends from back home… I basically collapse on my bed each night.

So far, college has been quite the adventure and I can’t wait to continue trying new things and meeting new people :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: How a group of middle schoolers transformed their math journeys by beating high schoolers

I just spent the past summer brushing up on all my math in preparation for college. Which had me reflecting:

Eighth grade is a big year for middle school math.

Algebra is a breakpoint in education.

For many students it’s harder than any subject they’ve studied to date. Somewhere in algebra class many students decide “I’m not a math person”.

But giving up on math at algebra sets a student up for a frustrating high school experience. Both science and math classes become a motivational struggle.

And math skills are often a necessary prerequisite for a student's goals – even if the goal is just to get into a good college.

You probably know students who've decided they're bad at math after 8th grade. Maybe you were one of them.

Alpha just turned this problem on its head – and for only $100 per student.

A few weeks ago, [Alpha](https://alpha.school/) created a competition for their middle school students: beat the high schoolers in math. That already is plenty of incentive – younger kids love the challenge of outperforming their older role models.

But there was an added sweetener: if a group of twenty students were able to complete more [XP in Math Academy](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-130-how-and-why-to) (basically the goal is to learn more math content) than the high schoolers did, they would win $2,500 to split between themselves.

Here were the results:

* Middle school beat high school by 25%
* Middle schoolers completed up to ⅓ of a grade level in just one week

All of the kids now know they can do an entire grade level in weeks, not a full year. They have so much more belief in their capabilities.

You might be wondering: *why this competition, specifically?*

Well, two things are almost universally true for middle schools students:

1. They’re often scared of the high school workload
2. They worship high school students

So, the self-confidence they gain from “learning more than high schoolers” becomes a long-term confidence anchor.

This self-confidence is critical for success later in high school – if they believe in themselves, they’ll be more willing to take risks and try challenging things, to push themselves to their fullest potential.

I’m so proud of this group of middle schoolers and can’t wait to see what their self-confidence allows them to accomplish.

### Don’t let your kid struggle with self-confidence (& tips on how to help your kid become successful)

Your kid is probably not confident in themselves.

Two months ago, the World Metrics Organization released heartbreaking [results](https://worldmetrics.org/self-confidence-statistics/) on self-esteem:

• 85% of people have low self-esteem.

• 7 out of 10 girls believe they are not good enough or don't measure up in some way, including their looks, performance in school, and relationships.

• Boys aged 15 have the lowest self-esteem of any group.

This affects *everyone*.

Yet “[studies](https://worldmetrics.org/self-confidence-statistics/) show that self-confidence makes a difference between success and mediocrity.”

So how can you help your kid get past their low self-esteem and have confidence and belief in their abilities?

Here are a few things that you, as a parent, can do:

**Build them up with small wins**

Make this fun – create small challenges for your kid to do in their free time or over the weekend so they can start proving to themselves that they are capable, intelligent, and strong.

These could be academic:

* Get 30 math facts on [QuickMath](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/quick-maths/id1105735200) in one minute
* Read a challenging chapter book
* Watch five [BrainPop](https://www.brainpop.com/) history videos and get a 100% on the quiz

Or physical:

* Bike one mile
* Hold a handstand for five seconds
* Throw a football 20 yards

Or mental:

* Journal for 20 minutes
* Wake up on the first alarm
* Solve a rubik's cube in three minutes

These, of course, start out small for younger kids, but you can keep building up as they get older.

And if they accomplish three challenges in one day, they can have a later bedtime (or something like that) as motivation.

**[Have them do online apps at home](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-127-the-self-belief)**

Academic success plays a huge role in self-confidence. Kids who struggle in multiple subjects often have trouble believing in themselves and their ability to succeed – even in areas beyond academics. So if your kid is struggling, have them use an online app like [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/learn) or [IXL](https://www.ixl.com/) for thirty minutes per day per subject to catch back up and regain their confidence. Help them feel that whenever they walk into a classroom, they’ll be able to learn whatever the topic is.

Academically crushing it is a really easy way for kids to start to increase their overall self-esteem – because school and grades are a huge part of their lives.

**Help them learn to [use social media productively](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-39-dont-put-screen)**

The growth of social media is tied to the declining self-confidence in kids – there’s no doubt about it.

In a [previous article](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-39-dont-put-screen), though, I outlined why I don’t believe just setting screen time limits for social media is the best way to get around the negative influences.

Instead, parents should spend time working with their kid to set up their TikTok feed (or other social media) in a way that ensures the content they’re getting is in some way productive or valuable. You can do this by:

* Asking your kid about the people they follow – why do they follow them, what do they gain from watching them (the answer can be as simple as “it makes me smile”), or, most importantly, how do they feel after watching their content?
* Talking about new accounts to follow that could be a better influence (skill building How-To videos, age-appropriate storytelling, TedTalks, academic fun facts, inspirational kids who are doing cool things, etc.)
* Discussing what types of content they watched or read about that day – encouraging critical thinking and debate about the concepts they saw

Many of these conversations aren’t easy. But it’s your job as a parent to ensure your kid is not a part of that 85%.

It's fully attainable, though – the students at Alpha are the proof.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [David Perell’s Sam Altman interview](https://x.com/david_perell/status/1838930040156807432?s=42)

I [joined David Perell](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-105-how-i-met-sam) for the first interview he did with Sam Altman back in March. Just a few weeks ago, David went back to California to conduct a “part two” of his interview – and I think I learned more from the reason behind the re-film than from the content of the interview (even though that’s amazing, too).

So why did David go back to the OpenAI office to interview one of the greatest CEOs of our time? His high standards.

Despite the fact that he interviewed *Sam Altman*, whose every word is like gold and who answered questions he’d never been asked before, David felt that this interview had *even more potential*.

An already incredible interview could get even better, and David wanted that.

No matter who he’s talking to or what the end result is, the most important lessons I’ve learned from David is what a high standard truly means and how much more you can accomplish if you’re always aiming for excellence.

2. [Assignment tracker](https://www.tiktok.com/@gracie.branham/video/7405029106150133022?_r=1&_t=8qA5clkrKId)

I’ve had so much anxiety in the last week about forgetting to turn in assignments or not completing the reading on time before class. To solve that, I followed the instructions in a TikTok video and created an assignment tracker on Google Sheets to help me keep track of assignments, readings, exams, and discussions. Here’s a quick snapshot of what mine looks like:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Eo2Q!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9d4c2df-104c-4c82-87dc-39e45cbec56f_1116x994.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Eo2Q!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9d4c2df-104c-4c82-87dc-39e45cbec56f_1116x994.png)

The TikTok tutorial is super easy to follow and I highly recommend helping your kid set one up for their school assignments, too. I’ve already had friends forget about a 50-page reading due the next day or discussion posts due the night *before* class, not the night after, so something like this would’ve been great.

I also get overwhelmed easily, and having everything written down and broken into small chunks makes everything seem simpler and more manageable.

3. [Robot Dreams](https://blogs.up.edu.pe/nubes/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Asimov-Robot-Dreams.pdf) by Isaac Asimov

I’m a *huge* fan of the *Foundation* series by Asimov, so when I heard we were reading one of his short stories for my *Rhetoric of Robots and AI* class, I was ecstatic. Asimov did not let me down.

“Robot Dreams” tackles ideas of the potential power of AI, what being human means, and figuring out your identity. Asimov really encourages the audience to think about what they would do if AI crossed that line from machine to human – and where that line even is.

If you like sci-fi, this is an intriguing, quick read and I highly recommend it.

Also – I’ve particularly enjoyed the class *Rhetoric of Robots and AI* not only because of the subject matter, but also because of the discussion we have. In high school, I was kind of alone in my obsession with books and breaking every part of them down, but here, every single person in the classroom participates in discussion about the stories and debates about the contentious topics. I’m so lucky to be at a place like Stanford where I’m surrounded by such incredible, motivated people.
