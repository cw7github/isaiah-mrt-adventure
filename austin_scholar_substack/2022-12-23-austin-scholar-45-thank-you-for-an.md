### **Hey, y'all!**

As the year is coming to a close, I really wanted to take the time to express how much I appreciate each and every one of you for subscribing to this newsletter.

I can’t put into words how much it means to me that you want to take time out of your week to read about my thoughts and experiences.

All I can really say is *thank you*. I’m so incredibly grateful.

Every week, I try my absolute best to put out a newsletter that you can both enjoy reading and find value in. I do not take that opportunity lightly and feel the responsibility to continuously create high-quality content.

That being said, my dad read last week’s perfectionism newsletter and asked me to take a break from publishing during the holidays. He told me I should take this time to recuperate and can start fresh in the new year. (I think he’s still trying to make up for his 6th-grade mistake.)

But, I couldn’t leave you guys with nothing, so I’m going to share my favorite questions to reflect on over the holidays. (Also–my next newsletter will be about reviewing the past year and how to set goals for the next, so watch out for that).

Ask your kid these questions, discuss them together–and perhaps ask them of yourself:

What one thing am I the proudest of accomplishing in 2022?

As a whole, did I spend my time this year in a way that aligns with my values?

What are some things in my life that “one-year ago me” wouldn’t believe?

What is the one thing that most dramatically improved my life?

Did I achieve the things I wanted to this year? Why or why not?

If I had to pick one thing that’s missing from my life, what would it be?

How can I make more time for myself, my relationships, and joy this next year?

**See y’all in the new year!**
