### **Hey, y'all!**

While I adore Pride month and all the love that comes with it, I know how hard June can be for people who haven't yet come out. It used to be awful for one of my best friends – one of the most wonderful people I have ever met.

Over the past couple of years, they've become unapologetically themselves. But when I met them in 2020, they were unable to look in a mirror because of how horrible their body made them feel.

But I’m getting a little ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. My (very positive!) experience coming out
2. How you should respond if your teen comes out
3. Scholar’s Sources: Information for LGBTQ+ families

So I’ve had a super busy week. My hair is now purple, I took two math finals, and I had my first week working at [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/).

The thing no one tells you about working remotely is how scary it is to log in your hours. *Are they going to think it’s bad that I spent two hours on this? Are they going to think I’m not putting enough time in? I’m getting paid* actual money*! What do I do?*

Yeah, I had an interesting week.

But I’m seriously super grateful to be a part of the Write of Passage team and excited to show y’all my journey at my first job :)

### My (Very Positive!) Experience Coming Out

I grew up hearing stories about my aunt who got kicked out of the family because she was gay.

I was in first grade when I asked my parents if my best friend and I could get married, as little kids do. They laughed it off and told me it was illegal.

I went to a Texan Catholic school for six years, so I didn't really think that being gay was an actual thing that existed.

And then.

And then, when I was fourteen years old and mad at my parents and on a journey of 'self-exploration,' I met this girl. She was soft-spoken and kind and held my hand after I cried and I thought she was the prettiest person I’d ever seen.

*I had a crush on a girl.*

Following that realization, some stuff about me made sense. Example: my adoration of [Hermione Granger](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger), or even my obsession with [K.C. Undercover](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/K.C._Undercover).

Over the next few days, I attempted to gauge my parents’ acceptance level. Is this a “kicked out of the family like your aunt” issue? Or is it a “let’s go to pride together” situation?

“Wow, the main character, the *female* main character, is so pretty and cool!”

“Look at these really cool articles, dad, about [GSA](https://gsanetwork.org/what-is-a-gsa/) in schools!”

Yeah, not very subtle.

It only took a few days before my dad stopped dancing around the issue. We went on a walk together and he pretty much asked me straight up: “Are you gay?”

For some reason, even after all of the ‘hints’ I had been dropping, actually admitting it was kind of scary, so I just nodded at him.

“Alright,” my dad said, “I’m super sorry for assuming that you liked boys. The same thing still applies: You deserve to date a girl as wonderful as yourself.”

He hugged me and we went back home, my ‘coming out story’ complete.

Now, my dad and I might’ve had our arguments, but I’m so grateful that this wasn’t one of them. My dad made me feel loved and accepted and cared for. To this day, my parents are still the second people I go to with girl problems (my sister is first, of course).

Because of how fabulously my parents handled my coming out, I feel really safe talking to them about relationship stuff, and honestly, I *want* to tell them about my crush on this girl I met [in Madrid](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-11-finding-your-tribe?s=w), because I know I will be welcomed with love, compassion, and of course, a few jokes about my “friend.”

### How You Should Respond If Your Teen Comes Out

Back to my lovely Californian friend. Let’s call them C.

When they came out as [non-binary](https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-non-binary-people-how-to-be-respectful-and-supportive) to their parents in 2019, their parents laughed and told them that they would grow out of it.

But C didn’t “grow out of it.” They spent years in a spiral of self-hatred because of their long hair, the name that they didn’t pick, and the body they didn’t want. And because C didn’t want to be rejected by their parents again, C didn’t say anything to their parents. Instead, C hurt themselves with [unsafe chest binding](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-chest-binding) – restricting their breathing and leaving them in immense physical pain. They hated themselves because of their body.

Finally, after countless threats from C of cutting their hair off, family therapy appointments, and long letters to and from their parents, C and their parents were able to rebuild trust between them. In 2021, after two years of risking their safety to feel like themselves, C’s parents bought them the highest-quality binder they could find.

It took a long time, but C got the acceptance they deserved.

Unfortunately, C had to suffer because their parents didn’t react well to their coming out. This is really common, but it doesn’t need to be the case.

This article will hopefully give you all the information and provide you with the tools you can use if your child comes out, to help keep them safe, loved, and happy.

Obviously, there’s no “perfect way” to handle your child’s coming out, but the core message that your teen is waiting for is *acceptance*.

While your teen might not be worried about getting kicked out or hurt, exposing who they are as a person is always scary. Whether she’s explaining how she wants to be a pianist when she grows up, or he’s saying he likes boys, it’s all terrifying.

Because simply being LGBTQ+ is a part of who your teenager might be, if you show hesitance in that acceptance, it might be a lot harder for your teen to come to you with other ideas, questions, or assertions about who they are. Not because they don’t want to share, but because they’re scared that you would react the same way.

(Example: C)

That’s why it is **crucial** that your teenager knows, without a shadow of a doubt, that you love and accept every piece of them– including their sexuality and gender.

If their coming out is a shock to you, make sure that your first priority is your child and making them feel loved. The processing can come later, if needed. Keep reading – before we’re done, I’ll share a list of sources that have a lot of information for LGBTQ+ families.

Saying something as simple as, “I love you and am so grateful that you told me,” is a great place to start.

In a lot of cases, teens will work themselves up and build up the actual coming out as, like, the worst thing in the world. For that reason, if you have questions about their identity or orientation, I would recommend waiting a few days before asking them about it, just so that the high of coming out can die down.

Love first. Acceptance first.

That is how your teen will come out (haha) of this experience feeling good and wanting to continue the conversation about who they are with you.

Yes, it is better than it was. No, not all gay kids are worried about getting brutally murdered anymore. Yes, we can get married in the United States.

But it’s not perfect.

High school boys think that pretending to be gay is the funniest joke ever. (And y’all wonder why I don’t like them. In a future issue, I’ll talk about the dangers of enabling high school boys.) Some really religious high schoolers post homophobic stuff on Instagram and defend it by misinterpreting a Bible verse.

“Gay” is still used as an insult. There is still a lot of stigma around being LGBTQ+. Some families *still aren’t* accepting. “The Gay Best Friend” is still the only media representation a lot of queer kids see.

So yeah, it’s better, but it’s not perfect.

Making sure that your teen feels supported by you could really help them get through a world that isn’t always set up to support them.

A great way to really start showing support is by celebrating Pride month with your teen.

A lot of people think that Pride is just rainbows and parades. They’re wrong.

Pride month is remembering and honoring those at [Stonewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots#:~:text=The%20Stonewall%20riots%20(also%20known,the%20Greenwich%20Village%20neighborhood%20of). Pride month is feeling surrounded by a loving community. Pride month is feeling at home in yourself.

Pride is loving yourself more than needing to be loved by others.

Pride month means love, community, and acceptance – what C had to fight so hard to get but was desperately craving all along.

If your teen is out, be one of those embarrassing parents who wears a rainbow pin in support. Be that parent who advocates for a GSA program at your school. Watch [Heartstopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartstopper_(TV_series)) with your kid.

**Celebrate your teenager for being brave and telling the world who they are.**

### Scholar’s Sources

[This](https://www.verywellfamily.com/a-parents-guide-to-lgbtq-community-4783527) is a really great article that explains all of the terminology in the LGBTQIA+ community. I know that my dad didn’t know *anything* beyond gay, straight, and transgender, but there are so many more experiences that people have in regards to their identity and orientation. Sexuality and gender are both spectrums.

This [website](https://www.mykidisgay.com/faq) has a ton of articles for helping families “understand their LGBTQ kids.” From sleepovers to breakups, there is an answer to basically any question.

[Here](https://beechacres.org/coming-out-a-guide-for-parents-of-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-queer-and-gender-expansive-lgbtq-youth/) is a “How to react if your kid comes out” article from a parent’s perspective. It has a lot of the same concepts that I’ve talked about, but explains them from a perspective that I don’t have.

This [resource list](https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/diverse-populations/lgbtq/lgbt-families/) from the Child Welfare Information Gateway has a *ton* of sources for LGBTQ+ safety and other super helpful organizations.

[Here](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/media/lgbt-facts-and-figures) are some really devastating statistics about the problems that LGBTQ+ youth (and adults) still face. There’s still a lot of work to be done. But it starts with love and acceptance.

**Please, let your teen have as amazing a coming-out story as I was able to have.**

**Thanks for reading. Go crush the week! See y'all on Wednesday.**
