### **Hey, y'all!**

Welcome to the Austin Scholar newsletter! To all of my new subscribers, I'm so excited and grateful that y'all are here! To all of my returning subscribers, welcome back, and thank you for the continued support.

Please forward this newsletter to other parents who want to learn ways to help make twelve years of school less painful and more fulfilling for their children.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. What I learned from dropping one of my 2022 APs
2. Tips for both parents and teenagers for dealing with AP stress
3. A source for parents on the negative effects of AP classes and two sources for teenagers outlining AP study methods

While the [previous newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-11-finding-your-tribe?s=w) was quite lighthearted, all about finding your people, this week’s newsletter is much more serious: AP stress. May is a month of constant testing. If not handled, testing anxiety can be super detrimental to your teenager’s mental health. I’ve got two APs this month, and here are my top tips for managing May.

Send this newsletter to your teen if they are struggling with APs.

### Austin’s Anecdote: My 2022 APs

AP classes are hard.

“Well, Austin, obviously AP classes are hard,” you might be thinking. But a lot of parents don’t understand just how hard these courses are.

At the beginning of this year, I was taking three APs: Language and Composition, Calculus BC, and World History. Which are all, like, basically impossible. Do you know how hard it is to learn 1,000 years of history, wars, politics, trade, economies, and everything else humans came up with? Or to completely master all of calculus, which fundamentally changes how you view math? Or to write three high-quality essays in two hours and fifteen minutes? Or to simply learn how to take the exam?

And in a few months.

All at the same time.

And for students (including me) who want to go to a good college, getting a 5 is a must.

So yeah, AP classes are really hard.

Now, I actually don’t completely hate Calculus. I find solving problems quite interesting and fun. And obviously, I like writing, so Language isn’t that bad either. But World History. I. Hate. AP. World. History.

Yes, history is interesting on its own and you can learn from it and all that jazz, but history tests are horrible. I can give you a ton of stories and context on the Silk Road, but if you ask me for the date that China introduced gunpowder on the trade route, I would tell you to look it up.

Also, the AP test is FOUR HOURS LONG. That is such a long test!

And because it’s such a hard AP, as the testing day grew closer, we were doing a practice test every week. On Friday. From 4:00 to 8:00.

No longer would I look forward to Fridays, to a relaxing night of Survivor and ice cream. Instead, I was at school doing AP World History.

Anyways, I was doing homework, taking practice tests, and watching [college board videos](https://www.collegeboard.org/) **all day**. The test was still months away and already my stress was through the roof. Not only that, but I wasn’t getting enough sleep because I was doing homework late into the night. ([Read Austin Scholar #10: Let Teenagers Take Naps](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-10-let-teenagers-take?s=w))

I was basically just a ball of anxiety at all times.

One morning, when I was talking (Read: complaining) about World History, I was asked why I haven’t dropped World History. I laughed and began talking about a beautiful fantasy world where I dropped AP World History and had my Friday nights back.

Apparently, it looked like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders.

I had so much anxiety that my brain didn’t even entertain the option of dropping the class until I actually started talking about it.

For the rest of the week, it was all I could think about. That Friday, I dropped the class and went home and watched Survivor and ate ice cream.

After dropping the class, I realized I was able to increase my focus on Calculus and Language, increasing my scores on practice tests. I realized that I would rather do really well on two APs than do okay on all three.

Obviously, I’m not suggesting that your kids drop all of their AP classes, but rather that they find ways to optimize their time and scores.

For me, That meant dropping the class I hated so I could spend more time getting a high score on the APs I actually cared about.

For someone else, it might be to go to sleep an hour earlier so they are more productive throughout the day.

For another person, it might be to start studying with friends.

The point is, AP tests are really hard and stressful, and finding ways to help your teenager with the stress is super helpful in increasing AP scores.

And trust me, I have a lot of tips for parents :)

### Article

Here are the things I’ve found most helpful for reducing AP stress:

#### For Parents–

1. **Tell your kids you’re proud of them.**

While this might seem cheesy, it is so important. A lot of teenagers, especially high-performing ones, tend to put a lot of their self-worth into grades and test scores, which is super unhealthy.

Parents can exacerbate this obsession by only talking to them about school or by only telling them you’re proud of them after they accomplish something. Teenagers are very emotional people, so these small things can reinforce the belief that they aren’t good enough if they aren’t getting good grades.

Reminding teenagers that they have value and deserve your love independent of school and grades is incredibly important. Really, just tell your kids you’re proud of them. In the future, I’ll write a full post on this :)

1. **Make sure they eat and sleep.**

Oftentimes teenagers will put off eating and sleep in favor of studying, so even just putting food in front of them and encouraging bedtimes can be a helpful reminder and improve their physical health.

1. **Cook or buy their favorite foods.**

Treating your kids for their hard work is positive reinforcement that they are doing something good– that simply the act of studying and trying is something to be proud of. Also, this can totally help teenagers de-stress and take a breather if they are eating something they love; it’s a form of comfort, which can help teens re-set and have the energy to keep going.

1. **Watch their favorite movie with them.**

There are multiple benefits to having a movie night:

* It’s another comforting thing. Watching familiar, enjoyable scenes can have a similar effect as the food: a re-set.
* The movie night is basically a forced break, which is definitely important.
* Being surrounded by family doing something fun is a great way for your teenager to feel loved while having time away from the anxiety of school.

#### For Teens–

Hey, y’all. I know AP season sucks. Obviously, I don’t have a perfect list, but these are a few of the things that have helped me and my friends get through May.

1. **Study with a friend.**

Trust me when I tell you that I wouldn’t have gotten a 5 on Human Geography last year if I didn’t study with my best friend. We literally spent, like, four hours every day the week before the test quizzing each other and explaining terms and describing models. It’s a great way to stay social and spend time with other humans while being productive. \*\*HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

1. **Get more sleep.**

I wrote an entire newsletter on this ([Austin Scholar #10: Let Teenagers Take Naps](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-10-let-teenagers-take?s=w)), but the vibe is that you need sleep to function. A lot of sleep. Like 9 hours. And you’ll do better on your tests if you [go to sleep an hour earlier instead of studying](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/26079/why-sleeping-may-be-more-important-than-studying). Seriously, get sleep.

1. **Take care of yourself.**

If you’re always studying and working, it can start to feel like that’s all you do, and the quality of studying time will decrease. Exhaustion, stress, and loss of motivation can make 30 minutes of homework take 3 hours. Rejuvenate your body and mind by taking a nice bath, doing your nails, putting on a sheet mask, deep-conditioning your hair, etc. It will make you feel a lot better.

1. **Take breaks.**

Taking a break is another thing that can help rejuvenate your mind!! Watch your favorite show!! Read a book!! Listen to music that’s not Study Music: Track 100!! Make sure you still have a life.

1. **Take notes.**

I know taking tedious notes can feel time-intensive and pointless, but notes can help make sure that your study time is productive, improve your memory, and allow you to look back at just the important parts of the lesson so you don’t have to re-read the whole thing. And, there are a ton of different types of note-taking, so just find one that works for you.

1. **Use study guides.**

Use pre-existing study guides!! Other people have taken this course before, and have posted study guides on what to focus on for the test!! Don’t spend time making your own study guide when there’s already one out there. (Unless, of course, it helps you remember things better.)

1. **Watch videos.**

Mix it up!! Take a break from the boring Barons’ or Princetons’ and watch a fun study video. You can also just watch videos while you’re getting ready for bed or sitting in a car if you need to cram.

1. **Take practice tests.**

This might seem obvious, but taking practice tests is super useful in helping you recognize what specifically you need to spend your time on. Also, familiarizing yourself with the test itself can be a determining factor in scoring well.

1. **Use comfort food or items.**

Feeling safe and happy (via the comforting things) will help you be more focused, motivated, and calm. (Ex. Wrap your favorite blanket around yourself while you study or treat yourself to hot chocolate before an intense homework session.)

1. **Use the Pomodoro method.**

[The Pomodoro method](https://pomodorokitty.com/) (25 minutes of studying, 5 minute break) is a great study method for long periods of time and helps to maximize focus during the work time. I love using this method because I always have a break to look forward to that’s not, like, an hour away. During the breaks, I like to do jumping jacks or eat a snack– anything that will help me reset before the next work block.

Realize this: You have value regardless of your test score. You, as a person, contribute to this world in so many ways that don’t even have to do with school. And let’s be real here, this one test score, while it might seem like the end of the world now, doesn’t have much impact on you in 25 years. Now, just close your eyes and breathe. You’ve got this.
