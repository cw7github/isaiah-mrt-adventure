### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. New ways to use AI in education (without ChatGPT)
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

I’ve had the absolute joy of spending the last week traveling with MacKenzie Price doing info sessions to help launch new Alpha Schools across the country. I spoke in D.C, Raleigh, and Charlotte and had a fantastic time getting to know the parents and students in the area. The info sessions themselves were so much fun – I got to talk about why I originally came to Alpha, the life skills I’ve learned while there, and how learning with AI-powered apps has impacted my college career. MacKenzie herself talks about the story behind Alpha and tells story after story of kids believing that they are limitless and are capable of doing things you couldn’t dream of.

Next week, Alpha is hosting info sessions in San Francisco, Plano, and Palm Beach. If you’re a parent of a kid K-3 and interested in becoming a founding family of an Alpha School in any of these three cities, I highly recommend [signing up](https://alpha.school/programs-events/). (To hopefully make the deal sweeter, anyone who attends an info session will get one month free of Austin Scholar, so spread the word.)

### New ways to use AI in education (without ChatGPT)

Today’s article is going to be more technical than usual. I got a lot of questions this week during the info sessions about using AI in education. Most people seem to think that AI in education means ChatGPT. But heads up for parents: 90% of kids already use ChatGPT in their education… for cheating. So we definitely need something different.

Alpha is developing new ways to use AI in education. Last [week](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-173-the-science-behind) demonstrated how Alpha uses AI-powered apps to crush the standard school curriculum.

But what about non-Common Core knowledge? What about all of the knowledge that’s not traditionally in a textbook?

AlphaX Projects are students’ high school passion projects (like this newsletter) and one of the requirements is that students become experts in their passion.

Today we’re gonna talk about three super experimental AI tools that Alpha has developed for Alpha High Students to use to develop that expertise: Brainmaxxing (ask your teen), BrainLifts and EPHOR. The three tools are anchored in the learning science concept “[depth of knowledge](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/webbs-depth-of-knowledge).”

While this article is detailed and technical, it gives a glimpse into how AI is going to radically change education going forward. I truly believe some derivative of this is going to be required of every student in the future.

Now, for those unfamiliar, a BrainLift is Alpha's framework for building expertise using DOK levels: Facts (DOK 1), Summaries (DOK 2), Insights (DOK 3), and Spiky POVs (DOK 4). But a BrainLift shouldn’t be a static document – it should be continuously updated as you learn.

The daily “Brainmaxxing” feed is how you keep your BrainLift at the cutting edge. Instead of building your DOK levels once and moving on, you spend one focused hour each day consuming expert content that challenges and upgrades every level of your BrainLift. By using [EPHOR](https://ephor.ai/home), you can upload your BrainLift to the platform and EPHOR will curate a personalized Brainmaxxing feed to help you continue to update your BrainLift and expand your knowledge.

The magic happens when this daily input continuously refines and expands each level of your BrainLift. Let me show you exactly how this works using my academic performance BrainLift:

Original DOK 1: Basic definition of spaced repetition as "reviewing material at increasing intervals"

After 30 days of feed: Now includes specific optimal spacing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month), forgetting curve mathematics, the latest neuroscience on memory consolidation during sleep, and how online, AI-powered apps like Math Academy use spaced repetition to ensure mastery. My DOK 1 went from elementary to graduate-level sophistication.

Original POV: AI will improve education

Current Spiky POV: Traditional education optimizes for the wrong variables. It selects for students who already have high intelligence and conscientiousness rather than developing these capabilities. AI-powered personalized learning with one-on-one motivation by “guides” can eliminate conscientiousness as a bottleneck and scaffold intelligence development, meaning ANY student can reach top 10% performance with the right tools and motivation systems.

This POV emerged from synthesizing dozens of expert insights across neuroscience, educational psychology, and AI research that my feed curated over weeks.

Here's the exact system I use to transform daily expert consumption into BrainLift upgrades:

Phase 1: Active consumption (45 minutes)

* Scan and flag (10 minutes): Quickly review all feed content, flagging anything that challenges current BrainLift knowledge
* Deep dive (35 minutes): Focus on 2-3 pieces that offer the highest potential for BrainLift enhancement

Phase 2: Integration (15 minutes)

* DOK level assessment: Determine which level of my BrainLift this new information impacts
* Contradiction identification: Note where new insights conflict with existing knowledge
* Connection mapping: Identify how this connects to other parts of my BrainLift

Phase 3: BrainLift updates (Weekly 30-minute sessions)

* Add new DOK 1 information and refine existing definitions
* Update DOK 2 content with better expert summaries
* Modify DOK 3 insights based on new strategic understanding
* Refine DOK 4 spiky POVs to be more precise and defensible

Every Sunday, I spend 30 minutes reviewing the week's feed highlights and asking three questions:

1. What challenged my existing thinking? (Usually leads to DOK 3-4 updates)
2. What new patterns emerged? (Often creates new DOK 3 insights)
3. What would I now argue differently? (Always refines DOK 4 POVs)

This systematic approach ensures my BrainLift stays current with the absolute cutting edge of knowledge in my domain.

Why is this better than traditional education and traditional lectures?

Well, there are a multitude of reasons:

* Students learn facts in September that may be outdated by December.
* Textbooks represent knowledge that's often 2-3 years behind current research.
* Students never learn how expert thinking actually works.
* Even the best teachers can only stay current with a fraction of the latest developments in their field.
* They become information middlemen rather than learning facilitators.
* Students optimize for tests rather than genuine expertise development, leading to knowledge that evaporates after exams.

On the other hand, Brainmaxxing and a BrainLift are pretty much the opposite:

* Your expertise grows continuously with the field rather than stagnating at textbook level.
* The AI feed adapts to your specific knowledge gaps and learning patterns, ensuring maximum growth efficiency.
* You're learning from the same sources that maintain cutting-edge expertise rather than filtered, simplified versions.
* The constant discovery of new insights and connections creates genuine intellectual excitement rather than grade-driven compliance.

Here's what most people don't realize about the BrainLift + feed combination: the benefits compound exponentially over time.

You start by primarily upgrading DOK 1-2 levels with better facts and summaries. Your thinking becomes more precise but not yet fundamentally different. As time goes on, you start generating original DOK 3 insights by connecting patterns across multiple expert sources. Your strategic thinking begins operating at expert level. Then, you begin to develop sophisticated DOK 4 POVs that challenge conventional wisdom. You're not just consuming expert knowledge – you're contributing to it. And your BrainLift contains insights that practicing experts in your field would find valuable. You've moved from student to practitioner-level thinking. Finally, you're identifying completely new patterns and frameworks that even experts haven't connected. Your BrainLift becomes a source of new knowledge rather than just a repository of existing knowledge.

Traditional education never reaches this level because it's designed to transfer static knowledge rather than develop true expertise.

What we're seeing with a BrainLift plus feed integration is the emergence of a completely new model for human knowledge development.

Students using this approach won't just outperform traditionally educated peers – they'll be operating in a completely different category. They'll have developed the cognitive tools for continuous expertise development in any domain they choose to pursue.

If you already have a BrainLift in any domain, here's how to supercharge it with a daily feed:

Step 1: Audit Your Current BrainLift

* Identify weak points at each DOK level
* Note areas where your knowledge feels stale or incomplete
* Flag insights and POVs you're least confident defending

Step 2: Design Your Feed Sources

* Academic sources: Latest research in your domain
* Practitioner sources: Blogs and insights from top performers
* Cross-domain sources: Applications of similar principles in other fields
* Contrarian sources: Perspectives that challenge mainstream thinking

Step 3: Establish Your Integration Routine

* Daily consumption: 45 minutes of active engagement with feed content
* Weekly synthesis: 30 minutes updating your BrainLift based on new insights
* Monthly review: Assess how your thinking has evolved and adjust feed sources

Step 4: Track Your Evolution

Document how your DOK 3 insights and DOK 4 POVs evolve over time. You'll be amazed at how sophisticated your thinking becomes.

As a whole, the combination of structured BrainLifts with dynamic daily feeds represents the future of learning. While traditional education systems debate incremental reforms, students with access to this approach are developing expertise at unprecedented speed and depth.

This isn't just about better grades or test scores. It's about developing the cognitive architecture for continuous learning and expert-level thinking in a rapidly changing world.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Thinking in Bets](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions/dp/0735216371/ref=sr_1_1?crid=O5E7XMAHCZ81&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._PL2S9l81duqnl2VIJNMHWhpUPlkQqCTUbw9ohQ85JKhLnkd8IrbPhdFi57OlxsRMc-N4LfH3QUitD59Mq3-bEJ0pxqz91mSDOyV2-qOCHOoW7jj4rUxJ9syfI-Db3TXOzE34f0-Cm-Kqshk6RGU5OKObwidj6tcRPF76MnGLs8MEgHxheZuNEw1tadXwFXfCmAMHbQbMIQMtsyeGP3EWmRY5PRPW0WZqOW1ArFX2X0.NZKjlzJQKe8p9G3LYquhvqLa6PkSbnf2_zHhaLeWvNQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=thinking+in+bets&qid=1752960361&s=books&sprefix=thinking+in+bet%2Cstripbooks%2C166&sr=1-1)

As a professional poker player turned decision-making expert, Duke shows how life is more like poker than chess – we're always making decisions with incomplete information. She taught me to think probabilistically about outcomes and to separate decision quality from outcome quality. Just because something didn't work out doesn't mean it was a bad decision – and the alternative is also true. Just because a decision you made had a good outcome doesn’t mean the decision itself was a good one. The second half of the book has a ton of fantastic mental models and strategies to look for accuracy and truth, not just results.

As someone who loves thinking about the world through numbers and logic, this was a perfect book for me and I highly recommend y’all check it out.

2. [Made in America](https://www.amazon.com/Sam-Walton-Made-America/dp/0553562835/ref=sr_1_1?crid=IVV3ERFE66BM&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g7A4ymLNQSNy0ZFMcqghJRDU0LsWHoHUxWnkqFqbRyzbDYY9kM1hB_igETHUIOFoigJz2vt9eRVn2E65FnpVzR1qAzESv3U3461HfWZS4fQH8RB_jSqAl7MiJm1taA-FGq5wsr3Sb3BlVeY7aa4n8CmP10yHo1rxLn-FElGGceshSYfc8wLhnELm6qO10FEbbEdQtdwuJXKl0q4TmUDrt59T-HXjjFx9Q91kFtKsPpM.ghA5TL6sb3FUDHVMB7WBBsEc5TTnozI78UZ-KG_gUSY&dib_tag=se&keywords=made+in+america&qid=1752960374&s=books&sprefix=made+in+americ%2Cstripbooks%2C139&sr=1-1)

As Alpha has begun scaling across America to help as many kids as possible, the founder of Walmart has a bunchof extremely relevant advice. My favorite lesson from Sam Walton’s autobiography was how hard you need to work to become an expert. Walton had a ton of incredible insights about the retail business, but it only came after years of visiting every discount store near him and watching how each does things, so that he could do it better. He knew everything about his competition, which allowed him to have industry insights before everyone else – variety stores to discounting to wholesaling. In the book, he says things to the effect of “it wasn’t a crazy decision to start discounting, it was an obvious one.” But it wasn’t obvious to everyone – just true experts in retailing.

The book itself is fantastic and full of incredible stories of hula dancing and buying planes to fly to every Wal-Mart in record speed and using satellites to scout locations.

3. [Zero to One](https://www.amazon.com/Start-Ups-Future-Paperback%E3%80%902018%E3%80%91-Author-Paperback/dp/B079NWNQ4D/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1LW15RE126IX3&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.F1NbgoVkJyjbb8Mx-3vB9UNaY1A_lf2RRntBVQxXk6O2zgL1qAJnKzaR-ivXcZXxnR2X_wEj4F6EGYo5FrJEk2rACpaPFBay7yT8e4toqSp7kCRfuMUC5GlsSrLJGe6W257qA0jW1ltK1DJYHj-Dmu0_UCh3DPmUTmGcp8hQE8PvEYxC1b7jYU1EKGY8_zRJ9G_NdC97ksLs7vApJF4k-o1W_OYMtP0rwGbTFavc0TQ.8gThmIeT7LB50Ps9beMypzIoRJWI-NJNtqJgV3OEmuM&dib_tag=se&keywords=zero+to+one&qid=1752960388&s=books&sprefix=zero+to+on%2Cstripbooks%2C137&sr=1-2)

While I think both Thinking in Bets and Made in America would be interesting to a wide range of people, Peter Thiel’s Zero to One definitely requires some sort of interest in startups and entrepreneurship. Thiel's whole thesis is that the best businesses aren’t about competing in the market – they’re about creating something so new that you don't *have* competition. How do you do that? Start with this question: what important truth do very few people agree with you on? My answer to this question is pretty much what Alpha is based on: kids must love school, kids can learn all academic content in two hours per day with an AI tutor, and kids are limitless.
