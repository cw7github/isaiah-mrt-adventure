### Austin’s Anecdote: Why I don’t want to be “good for my age”

While I was writing my 100th newsletter (which took a very long time – those hundred insights weren’t easy), I reflected on what allowed me to have these ideas and accomplish these great things.

And it all really came down to one core value: “You don’t want to be judged as ‘good for your age’ – you want to be good. Period.”

This value has been instilled in me since I was very young, when my dad started me on DreamBOX, a learning app that allows students to move through academic content at their own pace. My age didn’t mean my abilities were hindered by my grade level – I was able to move above and beyond through courses, eventually completing eighth-grade DreamBOX by the time I finished fourth grade.

In sixth grade, my Alpha classmates and I took the entrance exam to Austin Community College, and we passed it. By sixth grade, I was already a college student, ready to take on my very first college class: accounting. Yes, tiny little sixth-grade me took a college accounting class. And I got an A on my final.

I took this message, this value, to my sophomore year of high school, when I signed up to join David Perell’s Write of Passage, an online writing class for adults. When David realized a fifteen-year-old had signed up for his class, he was – justifiably – wary. I had to prove to him that my writing and my ideas were good enough to stand with the grown-ups. And after just the first session, David sent me DMs he was receiving from other adults in the course explaining that they learned a lot from being in a breakout room with me – and that my writing was impressive. David was impressed – and I had proven to myself, yet again, that age was not a constraint. After Write of Passage, David hired me to create a similar online writing course for teenagers, because he too was now convinced of what teenagers are capable of.

And finally, the summer before my senior year of high school, my sister, our friend, and I were tasked to launch Learn and Earn in Ukraine. During our time in Europe, we did things no adult could even dream of – launched a program to help thousands of Ukrainian refugees get their educations back on track, lived on our own in a war-torn country for three weeks, and wrote and filmed a high-quality documentary about our journey. For me, the bar is not “good for my age.” I want to do impressive things, regardless of how old I am.

### How to help your kid do impressive things. Period.

Now it’s your turn to help your kid do impressive things. Period. To teach them that their age doesn’t hinder their ability to do something cool.

It all starts with a mindset shift. You yourself have to believe that your kid can do something awesome. When you doubt, they can feel your apprehension and will remember your statements about how “this is really hard for *your age*, so don’t worry if it doesn’t work out.” You have to believe in your kid first and support all of their ambitions.

Your kid doesn’t have to start by creating an [Olympic-level project](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-92-y-school). There are a ton of different, smaller projects your kid can do to start showing that they’re actually good at something, not just “good for their age.” Here are a few examples:

1. Submit writing to a literary magazine

Even if their writing doesn’t make it in, submitting something to compete with other adults’ work is a total mindset shift for your kid. In middle school, Alpha students did a workshop where we submitted a recipe and short story to a magazine. None of us got our work published, but we raised the bar for ourselves because we knew we were competing with adults. Then, in high school, I was finally able to get my writing published in an official magazine – which I wouldn’t have been able to do if I hadn’t raised my bar early on.

2. Start a business providing services to adults

When I was in fifth grade, for one of my Alpha goals, I learned how to make a three course meal (a seafood tower, both a caesar and a wedge salad, and different types of steak at different temperatures – plus sides of mashed potatoes, broccoli, and brussels sprouts, with a complicated chocolate dessert) and held an official dinner where I cooked and served everything to a group of eight adults – and charged them $100 for the meal. I knew I was charging a lot and was providing a service to people I respected, so my bar was raised high. My meal had to be better than they would’ve gotten at a nice restaurant. Providing a service to adults is a great way to force kids to achieve “adult-level” things.

3. Do online college courses

There are hundreds of online college courses out there, and they’re honestly a great place to start helping your kid reset their standards. If they find a college course in their area of interest and work on it over the weekends or on school breaks, when they complete it, they’ll have a new sense of confidence in their academic abilities.

Doing impressive things is something all kids want to do, but they’re hindered by the “good for your age” trap. Encourage them to raise their bar. To do something impressive, period.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

I’m writing this newsletter a little earlier in the week because I’m visiting Stanford this weekend!! I’m super excited to see the place I’m going to spend the next four years – and to scope out my new pilates classes and coffee shops.

Also – one of my goals this week was to practice the DBT skill of [“Sleep Hygiene”](https://dbtselfhelp.com/sleep-hygiene-protocol/) every night (consistent sleep schedule, don’t use your bed for anything other than sleep, keep your room dark and cold, do not catastrophize, etc.), which I feel has totally improved my quality of sleep.

1. [Murder Your Employer](https://www.amazon.com/Murder-Your-Employer-McMasters-Homicide/dp/1451648219)

As it was one of my “fun” reading weeks, I picked up Murder Your Employer – and my goodness, was it an exciting book to read. I love mysteries and crime novels, so it was cool to read from the perspective of the assailant. Loved this book: ⅘ stars for me.

2. [Relentlessness](https://x.com/brianjji/status/1749941691086237696?s=46&t=dnLfnUxpmdxs8dXuvH7k-g)

This post is such a great reminder of the constant, hard work that goes into being successful. As someone who is currently battling senioritis, it’s more important than ever for me to keep up the momentum and continue being relentless in my work.

3. [Grammys Predictions](https://www.billboard.com/lists/grammy-predictions-2024-album-of-the-year-best-new-artist/album-of-the-year-3/)

As a music lover, I’m so excited for this year’s Grammy Awards, as so many of my favorite artists are nominated. Reading predictions is always really fun and causes lots of debate among my friends.
