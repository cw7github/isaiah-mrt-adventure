### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How to get an internship at NASA
2. The importance of rules and my thoughts on The Sovereign Child
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

Happy Easter Sunday everyone! I hope you’re having a truly beautiful day. I’m so blessed to be able to spend the day with my family – I came back to Austin this weekend! It’s been a truly crazy first few weeks back at school and I’m super excited to have a chill, relaxing time with my family before midterms start up again. I don’t know about you, but I feel like I’m always talking about taking midterms in my update section :) For this round of midterms (I have math this week, then CS in two weeks, then math again the week after that), I’m studying three ways:

1. Post-lecture reviews

I’ve been super organized these last few weeks because after every lecture, I write the main concepts and takeaways in my own words and screenshot the most important slides that I should review for exams. So step one is to review my lecture notes.

2. Practice tests

As per usual, I’m loading up on practice tests to prepare. While this is (already) going to be my third time taking a Stanford math midterm, I’m currently taking my first CS class and don’t know exactly what types of questions I’ll be asked on the exam – so practice is critical. If I’m comfortable enough with answering questions and I understand what the professors are looking for, I know I’ll do a lot better on the actual exam.

3. ChatGPT!

ChatGPT will always be my best friend while studying. For this prompt, I upload all of the lecture slides and ask the following:

*I’m preparing for my [class] exam. You are the TA for [class]. Use the lecture slides to come up with practice problems for me. Ask me one at a time and if I get it wrong, ask me guiding questions to find the solution – DO NOT tell me the answer. Keep asking questions until I’ve gotten at least five questions correct in every lecture topic.*

### Austin’s Anecdote: Advice from a Stanford freshman

Earlier this week, I talked to one of my good friends [Giselle Ransom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giselle-ransom-6142b9264/), a Stanford freshman who interned at NASA.

I asked her about the two pieces of advice that she would give to parents who want to help their kid achieve things on a similar scale. Here’s what she said:

1. “Create a reward system in which students are actively incentivized to work. My mom encouraged me through paying for As.”

I’ve talked a lot about creating a reward system (starting all the way back with [this](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-41-yes-you-should) newsletter), so I love that this is something Giselle also found encouraging. I think this highlights part of the “high support” aspect of parenting that Dr. David Yeager discusses in his book, *10 to 25* that I break down in [this newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-151-why-you-and-your), in that you’re constantly encouraging your kid and providing them with motivation to achieve hard things.

2. “Do not create a toxic environment in which a student lacks ambition. Ambition is necessary for long term success and achievement in my eyes.”

This is where I think the “high standards” part of Dr. Yeager’s philosophy comes in – you have to teach your kid to want to do hard things and achieve greatness. If that’s not a value in your family, your kid won’t care.

If you’d like to dig deeper into Giselle’s story, she also has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GiselleRansom), where she posts videos about Stanford and gives advice for college admissions. You should definitely check it out if you have a high schooler.

### The importance of rules and my thoughts on The Sovereign Child

A few weeks ago, I mentioned that I’d been introduced to the book *The Sovereign Child* by Aaron Stupple, and this week I wrote the promised newsletter diving into my thoughts on the book.

Let me start by saying that there is undeniable value in letting children make their own decisions and experience the consequences. This is something many parents struggle with, and those who master it give their children a powerful gift – the ability to learn through trial and error.

However, I’m not convinced that the solution is to eliminate rules altogether. Whether you’re like me (someone who learns by following the rules) or like my sister (who learns by breaking them), rules provide a framework for understanding the difference between “healthy” and “unhealthy” choices.

In my view, the issues Stupple raises aren’t caused by the existence of rules, but by how they are enforced. Stupple seems to catastrophize the impact of rules on children, suggesting that they inherently damage parent-child relationships and stifle creativity. I don’t think this is exactly true.

Rules don’t have to be harmful or authoritarian. Parents can use them as starting points for conversations, not as absolute barriers. When disagreements arise, rules can be productive rather than destructive.

The key is how parents react when their rules get broken. If the response signals a willingness to discuss and negotiate, it allows your kids to still be active agents in their own lives, which means their autonomy and creativity can still exist.

Also, there definitely doesn’t need to be a million rules controlling every move your kid makes; I’d argue it’s more helpful to have a few core rules to guide their overall choices, and to let them experiment with the stuff that doesn’t matter as much.

For example, these are the rules I’ve mentioned before that my family had:

* If my sister and I had an argument, we had to hug it out (Mom enforced)
* If we’re out late, we have to text our mom and let her know where we are and what we’re doing (Mom enforced)

These two rules emphasized the value of family and staying connected – something that has become deeply ingrained in my own outlook on life.

* No sleepovers on weekdays (Dad enforced)
* No drinking or drugs (Dad enforced)
* You can stay up however late you want, as long as you’re reading and as long as you don’t complain about being tired the next day (Dad enforced)

These rules emphasized both the value of working hard (in that during the week, we had to stay locked in), but also the value of playing hard (in that the only real rule we had about hanging out with our friends was that we couldn’t drink or do drugs). That was the line – everything else we could work out.

This is what worked for my family and what helped guide my sister’s and my behavior throughout childhood. Now, let’s dive into the first five chapters of *The Sovereign Child* and my thoughts on each chapter.

---

1. Eating What They Want

Stupple argues that children should have complete freedom over their diet. He believes food rules create shame and disrupt children’s relationship with eating, and that kids should be trusted to learn from natural consequences.

While I agree with giving kids some autonomy in food choices, I don’t think it’s wrong to have a framework. Encouraging balanced meals or providing guidance on nutrition doesn’t have to stifle independence. For example, parents can offer healthy options while allowing treats, showing kids what they believe are good choices without forcing compliance. For example, you could allow your kid to choose between, say, a bowl of strawberries (maybe with a little bit of whipped cream?) and two Oreos for dessert. You would, of course, have the strawberries. Model the healthy choice and allow your kid to make their own choices. This allows your kid to have freedom while also not being able to have an entire box of Oreos for dessert. These boundaries give children a foundation to understand and explore their own preferences.

2. Sleeping When They Want

Stupple criticizes bedtime rules, arguing that children should sleep when they feel tired, as sleep is deeply personal. He believes bedtime enforcement causes anxiety and resentment.

I can see the value in flexibility, especially as children’s sleep needs vary. However, I think routines can provide structure without being coercive. A bedtime doesn’t have to be a strict mandate – it can be a shared framework that teaches the importance of rest. For example, you can have a rule like we did, where we could stay up as late as we wanted to as long as we were reading a book. Or you do something as simple as *you can stay up as late as you want, but you can’t complain about being tired the next day*.

3. Watching What They Want (Screens)

Stupple defends unlimited screen time, arguing that screens are tools for creativity and learning. He challenges the narrative that screens inherently “crowd out” more valuable activities.

While I agree that screens are invaluable parts of life in 2025, I think some boundaries are helpful. Rules around screen time don’t have to be restrictive but can guide children toward balance. I’ve written a [newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-39-dont-put-screen) about how to interact with screens productively, so definitely check that out.

4. The Four Problems with Rules

Stupple identifies four ways rules harm children:

1. They damage parent-child relationships.
2. They harm children’s relationship with themselves, fostering shame and insecurity.
3. They confuse children about problem-solving.
4. They teach dependency on external authority instead of autonomy.

While I appreciate Stupple’s concern, I don’t think rules are inherently destructive. Rules can be presented as collaborative guidelines, not arbitrary mandates. When parents model empathy and understanding, disagreements about rules can become opportunities to teach problem-solving and respect. For example, if a child breaks a rule, the parent can explain their reasoning and listen to the child’s perspective, rather than defaulting to punishment. I think that rules only harm a relationship when they’re implemented in an authoritarian way, rather than in dialogue or discussion. As long as you’re willing to both compromise on the smaller issues and explain your reasoning for having a rule in a way that resonates with your kid, I think that these rules actually help kids learn how to navigate the world.

5. Parenting Without Rules

Stupple argues for replacing rules with “win-win” solutions crafted collaboratively with children. For example, if a child draws on the wall, instead of forbidding it, parents could provide large paper or an easel as an alternative.

I love the idea of finding creative solutions, but I don’t think this approach eliminates the need for rules entirely. Some rules – like no hitting or no running into the street – are essential for safety and clarity. These “big rules” provide a foundation while still leaving room for collaboration and flexibility in the rest of their lives.

And these rules can change over time. Eventually, you won’t have to tell your kid not to run in the street. Instead you’ll be telling them that they can’t use their phone while they’re driving.

---

While *The Sovereign Child* offers valuable insights into fostering autonomy and creativity, I believe rules (or boundaries) still have a place in parenting. Rules provide a framework for children to understand their parents’ values and make informed decisions. Disagreements about rules can be productive rather than destructive, as long as parents respond with empathy and a willingness to collaborate.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. Last minute AP studying

My sister has been crushed under all of her AP studying – and all I have to say is that I’m so glad I’m through with that. But that doesn’t mean I don’t remember how to study for them!

If your kid realized that they need to learn all of the AP content for one class in two weeks, have them use these tools:

* [Fiveable](https://fiveable.me/)

Fiveable was always one of my favorite resources to learn content. The articles are pretty engaging and group the content in memorable ways; however, the questions are super easy and definitely not as hard as exam questions.

* [Albert](https://www.albert.io/)

If you want AP-level practice questions, Albert is the place to go. Super hard questions and great explanations.

* [AP Classroom](https://myap.collegeboard.org/login)

The best part about AP classroom is the AP daily videos. They’re super thorough and go over every single sub-topic that will be tested, so if you’re struggling with a specific topic, check these out.

* ChatGPT

ChatGPT is always a great resource for studying. You can use prompts like the one I discussed in my updates section to test your knowledge, along with more general prompts targeting the actual learning of the material. To do that, upload the topics in your textbook or a pdf of the content you need to learn, then ask ChatGPT to explain the concepts to you like you’re five years old, highlight the main ideas, and create a study plan to prepare for the exam. Check out [this newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-60-why-and-how-your) to learn more about using ChatGPT to study for APs.

2. [GT School](https://x.com/mbateman/status/1910765500495483360)

Students at GT School learn five times faster than those at a traditional school. Most parents know that schools hold their GT kid back, but don't know just how much. GT School is open for enrollment for the fall, so if you live in the Austin area, I highly recommend checking it out.

I wrote an [article](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-153-how-alpha-students) two months ago introducing GT School, so definitely read that if you’re interested in an overview on the results. The thread I have linked, though, dives into the data and more specifics on GT School and the guides that would be working with your student.

Don’t let traditional school stifle your child’s potential. Take advantage of the opportunity that GT School presents.

3. [Survivor 48](https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Survivor_48)

I think my love for Survivor is ingrained in my bones at this point. Season 48 of Survivor is coming out now and I have to say that it embodies one of (in my opinion) the most interesting parts of the show: the fact that it exposes both what players value and what they *think* they value.

For the last few episodes, there’s been a group of players who are in an “honesty and integrity” alliance, and all they talk about is wanting to play Survivor with honesty and integrity, and to vote out the “weak” players (those who are physically weak or simply just not a part of this alliance) now so that only the “strong” players (the physically dominant players who are a part of this alliance) make it to the end and can battle it out from there.

While I do believe that these players believe that they value honesty and integrity over anything else, their actions show that’s not true. There have already been multiple blindsides this season (the players were not honest about who they were going to vote out) and every player in the alliance has talked about wanting to get Shauhin (a physically pretty strong player, but mentally and socially brilliant) out. Not only does this go against the alliance and is therefore not honest, but it also goes against the value of wanting the strong players to make it to the end.

All of this to say: one thing that Survivor shows is that, when it comes down to it, people will value themselves and their loved ones above all else. It doesn’t matter how strong your conviction for honesty or integrity is, if you have to lie, cheat, or steal to help yourself or your family in a major way (i.e. winning a million dollars), you will.

Also, one of my dorm mates at Stanford is good friends with a castaway ([Kamilla](https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kamilla_Karthigesu)) on this season – so I’m rooting for Kamilla this season and I hope you do too!
