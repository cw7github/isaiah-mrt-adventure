### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: My 2023 review
2. From spreadsheets to soul-searching – how to review your 2023

Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all of y’all!! I hope your holidays were restful, joyful, and spent with loved ones.

I wanted to give you one last punchy newsletter before 2024, so this week we’re talking about end-of-year reviews. I hope you enjoy!!

### Austin’s Anecdote: My 2023 review

I truly cannot believe that 2023 is already over. What a year it’s been.

At the beginning of the year, you may remember I set some goals for myself:

* Reach 100,000 Twitter followers
* Get 5,000 paid Austin Scholar subscribers
* Get a 1520+ SAT score
* Apply to college

The first two were definitely not met. Unfortunately, my audience-building skills are not up to par just yet, and had a hand in my failing to achieve these goals.

But the second two? Absolutely crushed.

Not only did I get above a 1520 SAT score, but I got a *perfect 1600* SAT score.

And I didn’t just apply to college, I got into Stanford!!

I had failures this year, but I also had some pretty sweet successes. (And is this not itself the most insane growth? Two years ago, I would’ve been fixating on the losses and feeling terrible about myself. Now, I understand where I have room to improve, but I also recognize where I’ve done well.)

Let’s look at some other things I’ve done this year:

* Launched Learn and Earn

  + Hosted and put together a 2-day event for 500 Ukrainian refugee students
  + Created a long-term program to help Ukrainian kids get their education back on track
  + Raised over 1 million dollars for the Learn and Earn program
  + Created a documentary on the project
  + Currently  helping thousands of Ukrainian students
  + Working on a second in-person event in Poland
* Wrote for actual magazines??

  + Published an [article](https://spectator.org/adaptive-apps-new-technology-adjusts-lessons-based-on-students-skill-levels/) in The American Spectator
  + Was Austin Women Magazine’s Woman to Watch

    - Ran an Austin Scholar booth at their event
* Landed all of my single jumps (apart from the Axel) in skating

  + Created a routine to Taylor Swift’s my tears ricochet
* Met incredible people

  + Sahil Bloom
  + Ali Abdaal
  + Tim Urban
  + Tim Ferriss

I am just so blessed and grateful for the year I’ve had. I’m incredibly proud of myself for all of the work I’ve put in, and thankful to all of you who have made this possible for me.

I can’t wait to continue to get better at writing, actually meet my audience-building goals, and become a stronger, kinder, and more loving person.

### From spreadsheets to soul-searching – how to review your 2023

I have two ways I review my year – one is more formulaic (where I actually sit down intending to analyze my year) and the other is more emotional (used late at night when I’m overthinking everything about my life).

I’ll break down both here:

**Yearly Review (the formula version)**

In this version, I create a spreadsheet of my values and measures of success and failure with each. Doesn’t have to be anything fancy.

Here’s an example of mine – I just filled out the first column so you can see how it works:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9yce!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc09bbd40-18d7-45bd-a80d-f743fca0455c_1600x233.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9yce!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc09bbd40-18d7-45bd-a80d-f743fca0455c_1600x233.png)

And here is my updated Values Pie Chart I used to create this. Read [last year’s review](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-46-how-to-set-your) to learn how to make your own.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BRl8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5bbdc05-cde3-437b-b658-38dfa2dbd926_1556x780.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BRl8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5bbdc05-cde3-437b-b658-38dfa2dbd926_1556x780.png)

Then, use the inputs in the spreadsheet to analyze your year. (My favorite way to analyze is looking at the percentage of my day I spend on a particular activity versus what percent of my Values Pie Chart it takes up.)

You can, of course, add more measures (such as money spent, how happy you are with your accomplishments, etc.), but this is a great starting point.

**Yearly Review (the emotional version)**

This version is a lot less exact. Here’s how it works:

Ask yourself the following:

* How does 2023 make me feel?
* Right now, what does success look like for me, and did I work towards it every day in 2023?
* When was I happiest this year?
* When was I saddest this year?
* What makes me feel warm and fuzzy about the year?

…and these questions from last year’s review:

* What one thing am I the proudest of accomplishing in 2023?
* What are some things in my life that "one-year ago me" wouldn't believe?
* What is the one thing that most dramatically improved my life?
* Did I achieve the things I wanted to this year? Why or why not?
* As a whole, did I spend my time this year in a way that aligns with my values?

Tackle these questions like you’d tackle journaling prompts. Use whatever format feels best: speak out your thoughts into [Otter](https://otter.ai/), write them in a physical journal, or use an online writing tool. The goal here is to get all of your thoughts, feelings, and emotions about 2023 on paper. Go off on tangents. Take breaks and come back. Make yourself cry. Make yourself laugh. Use this space to take yourself through the journey that was 2023.

This is great on its own, so you can stop here. But if you want to go a step further, you can also identify patterns in your 2023 brain dump. You can do this yourself… or you can have AI do it for you (you already know that’s what I did).

Ask ChatGPT to “Analyze my thoughts on 2023 and find patterns in things that made me happy, things that made me sad, things that made me proud, what my biggest achievements were, what I can improve on most, and how my life has changed throughout the year.”

Both the formula version and the emotional version will lead to a great analysis of your year, so choose whichever one speaks to you most – or do a combination of the two, which is usually what I do.

Keep your eye out for next week’s newsletter on using this review to set goals for 2024 :)

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been reading…

1. [Cat’s Cradle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135479.Cat_s_Cradle) by Kurt Vonnegut and [Murder on the Christmas Express](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/85150686) by Alexandra Benedict

These two books were my vacation reads:

I call myself a Kurt Vonnegut fan, but I hadn’t actually read Cat’s Cradle. I wasn’t disappointed. Vonnegut’s writing is, as always, magical, weird, and incredibly memorable. Loved it. 4.5/5 stars.

Now, for Murder on the Christmas Express, I was expecting some super dramatic twist at the end like Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express (a 5/5 read for me), but I was pretty disappointed. The writing was engaging, though, so I gave it 3/5 stars.

2. College preparation articles and TikToks

After getting accepted into Stanford, the reality of college has begun to sink in. So, naturally, I’ve started reading every prep article out there and my entire TikTok For You page is filled with “advice for freshmen” videos.

[This](https://www.unigo.com/colleges/stanford-university/what-should-every-freshman-at-your-school-know-before-they-start) is my favorite site so far, and it works for a bunch of schools. Definitely worth checking out if your kid is headed to college.

3. [The Office](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/)

My family spent the holidays with our best family friends, and we’ve all been getting together to watch The Office every night before bed. Such a funny show that brings so much nostalgia and connection.
