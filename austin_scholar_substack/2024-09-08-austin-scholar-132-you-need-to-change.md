### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: 2 Hour Learning in Brownsville, TX
2. You need to change how you’re talking to your kid about school
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about

So: my family has officially moved!! For me, of course, this means having packed up all of my stuff this last week, unpacking and living in our new home for two weeks, then packing back up to move to California. I’m in love with my new room (instead of sleeping in my closet, I have an actual bed and my desk is perfect for newsletter writing). If my parents wanted to have an excuse for me to want to come home for every break, they’ve now got one :)

In other news, I finally landed my first off-ice axel (practicing the jump in my socks and in my living room), so now I just have to get over my mental blocks and land one in my skates. I’ve also refreshed my Algebra II by helping my sister and her friends with their math, and I’m 40% completed with Calculus II on Math Academy. Overall, it’s been a very productive, physically taxing, and fulfilling week.

### Austin’s Anecdote: 2 Hour Learning in Brownsville, TX

Whenever I post about 2 Hour Learning on Twitter/X, I receive a *ton* of comments arguing that this way of learning only works for “smart people” and that it “wouldn’t work for anyone who wasn’t already in the top 10% nationwide.”

Additionally numerous studies in the United States discuss the link between income and education. For [example](https://ballardbrief.byu.edu/issue-briefs/the-socioeconomic-achievement-gap-in-the-us-public-schools), studies show that lower-income students typically perform 3 academic years behind median-and-high-income students.

And according to these studies, low-income students enter high school 5 years behind their counterparts when it comes to literacy skills.

[Unfortunately](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/28/the-real-reason-why-poor-kids-perform-worse-in-school-and-in-life/), “the fates of generations of poor children [are] largely sealed before they even set foot in a classroom.”

But it’s not their socioeconomic status – or even all of the other factors related to that status – that cause this disparity.

How can I make this claim? Well, two years ago, my school decided to open up a campus in one of the poorest cities in America: Brownsville, TX.

In Brownsville, over a third of its citizens live in poverty.

But its Alpha campus was run in the same way as our Austin campus: using online apps to learn instead of teachers.

As you can imagine, the socioeconomic status of the students at the Brownsville campus was vastly different than that at the Austin campus.

But you’ll be shocked to see the results.

After one year at the Brownsville campus, students were learning 1.4x as much as the average student in a traditional classroom would.

As expected, however, our Austin students significantly surpassed this at 2.4x.

But just one year later, their performance accelerated past our Austin students.

We didn’t expect that.

Brownsville learned at 2.9x compared to the average student in a traditional classroom, and Austin learned at just 2.6x.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a3re!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc15cc37-add5-44b9-a553-0429a4eea547_1272x764.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a3re!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc15cc37-add5-44b9-a553-0429a4eea547_1272x764.png)

And yes, your understanding is correct – the low socioeconomic students living in one of the poorest cities in America surpassed the students living in the city with the fastest-growing number of millionaires. And they continue to do so.

The impact of this new way of learning is best demonstrated through the accomplishments of some of the individual kids.

One student from Brownsville completed a 3-week “get to grade level” sprint.

Through her app learning, she was able to catch up by 1.5 grade levels in 3 subjects during this time.

1.5 grade levels in 3 weeks – all through online apps.

This never would have happened in a traditional school setting.

Another student joined Alpha Brownsville this year.

His math achievement level when he joined was the 22nd percentile.

After just four months of learning through apps, his math achievement percentile absolutely skyrocketed to the 94th percentile.

He went from being in the bottom third nationally to the top 10%.

He’s 5 years old.

These two students – along with so many others – have opened the doors to so many more opportunities for themselves through their education.

This year, Texas Preparatory School is adopting 2 Hour Learning (using online apps to learn all academics) to help its students catch up in their academics and set them up for success later in their life. 2 Hour Learning will help its students at this charter school go from the bottom 10% in the country (not able to read or do basic math) to the *top* 10%.

Online apps are the great equalizer.

If we want to give every single child a chance of success – regardless of their socioeconomic status – then use apps to learn.

### You need to change how you’re talking to your kid about school

Parents: you need to change how you’re talking about school.

One thing that is almost universal in students who aren’t doing as well in school as they could be is that their parents have a terrible rhetoric around academics and learning at home.

Their parents say things like:

“School doesn’t *really* matter anyway.”

“You’re never going to use any of this stuff in the real world.”

These are dangerous words to say around kids. If they internalize them, they will start to think school and academics are as useless as their parents seem to suggest.

And so often kids in that bottom 50% just don’t believe they can reach the 90% percentile – that they can succeed in school. Kids believe the things their parents mirror for them. They think they're a bad student because they're being told that they are one.

If you don’t believe your kid can reach the top 10% nationwide, they won’t be able to.

When in reality, every single kid is capable of mastering every topic and every subject K-8. It’s the education system and the way they’re being taught the material that’s holding them back, along with the culture in their home that academics don’t matter.

So how do you change this?

Cultivate a mindset of the importance of academics:

* Create rewards for doing online apps at home to catch up to grade level
* Tell your kid they *can* succeed in school and you’ll help them do so
* Create vision boards to have a dream future to work towards
* Compliment their work ethic and abilities

Really, it all comes down to taking a more active role in your kid’s education.

Whatever your thoughts about the usefulness of academics and education, just know that language hurts your kid. Tell them you believe in them instead.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about

1. [The recreation of the study of Ramón Gómez de la Serna](https://www.condeduquemadrid.es/conde-duque/servicios/museo-de-arte-contemporaneo)

As we’re moving and deciding what art to put on our walls, I’ve found myself to not exactly be a fan of the “modern art” paintings that my sister seems to love.

(We have a red square in a picture frame in our entryway. I don’t get it.)

Thus, I’ve been thinking a lot about what I find to be beautiful art. And, well, possibly the most inspired I’ve ever been in my life is after visiting the Museum of Contemporary Art in Madrid where there was a reconstruction of a famous artist’s study.

I don’t know what it was about that reconstruction, but I couldn’t stop writing about it. The place felt like somewhere art was being made. A close second was visiting the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. My imagination danced throughout the building – tracing paths that great authors like C.S. Lewis and Tolkien had before. So I guess to me, art is something which incites emotion and activates imagination.

If a red square happens to do that for you, I guess that’s okay.

2. [Lessons to teach your kid before they turn 18](https://x.com/JohnLeFevre/status/1771929241375957263)

I absolutely love this list and it’s such a great reminder for me before I go to college.

Some of my favorites:

* Don’t wait for the perfect pitch
* Network (in-person)
* Write daily
* Look outside your social circle
* Never stop learning
* Focus on hobbies that will last a lifetime
* Focus on the habits, not the goals
* Don’t argue with idiots
* Say “thank you”

3. [Your kid is wasting their time in school](https://x.com/jonatanpallesen/status/1818184804891832797)

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M5R0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d57aa30-3d3f-49e2-b66d-4748705e2c7a_1200x750.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M5R0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d57aa30-3d3f-49e2-b66d-4748705e2c7a_1200x750.jpeg)

This graph truly makes me sad because all of my friends in traditional school spend hours and hours every single day on homework and a full eight hours in classes just to not learn anything.

We need to do better.

Stop wasting kids’ childhoods.
