### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How math fact fluency helped me excel in K-12
2. Why math fact fluency is so powerful
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

Last weekend I went home!! One of my best friends (who goes to Vanderbilt!!) had fall break and was in Austin, so I decided to visit as well. I had so much fun eating good barbeque, watching three football games in one day, completing an entire puzzle in two hours, listening to my sister talk about her new boyfriend, and procrastinating all of my school work. Despite all the distractions, I feel like going home was the reset I needed to get my head back in the game after being sick. It reminded me of how lucky I am to be at Stanford and that there will always be people at home who care about me and are willing to help me.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How math fact fluency helped me excel in K-12

Let’s start this off with a definition so we’re all on the same page.

According to the Google AI, “Math fact fluency means the ability to quickly and automatically recall basic math facts, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, without needing to consciously think about the answer, essentially achieving "automaticity" where students can retrieve these facts from memory effortlessly and accurately; it's considered a foundational skill for further mathematical development.”

Everyone knows about fluency in language – fluency in math is the same thing (understanding the ideas so clearly you don't have to think about them in order to use them, just like you don't have to consciously think about the words you're using to make sentences).

My journey with math fact fluency began in third grade, when this one boy in my math class and I raced each other to see who could finish their multiplication worksheet first. At that point in my education journey, it was critical that I could recall every multiplication fact from 1-12 extremely fast. Thus, my multiplication skills got pretty good.

At the same time, my dad had my sister and I doing ten minutes of [Quick Math](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/quick-maths/id1105735200) per day to try and beat *his* score in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

This consistent practice helped me become fluent in these basic functions.

After I’d beaten that boy a sufficient number of times and finally topped my dad’s score by one second, I put the idea of memorizing more math facts out of my head.

Yet math, of course, builds on itself. So being able to automatically know what 7x8 is or what 172-63 is helped me move more quickly through algebra and geometry and algebra two and pre-calculus.

Turns out, my mission to beat that boy in third grade paid off for *years*.

But once I got to Calculus, I realized there was a whole new set of math facts I had to become fluent in: derivatives and integrals.

If I get a complicated improper integral problem, I can’t spend all of my time trying to figure out what the integral of 1/x^2 is. If I want to keep moving (especially on something like a timed test), I need to know that part of the answer automatically.

So instead of working on those more complicated problems, I spent my time memorizing those derivative and integral rules. Then, once I was fluent in those facts, I turned back to the improper integrals and found myself able to complete them *so much faster*.

Understanding with automaticity the basic facts in a math class has allowed me to learn in [2 hours per day](https://2hourlearning.com/).

### Why math fact fluency is so powerful

According to a [literature review of math fact fluency](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1194585.pdf), “[w]hen automaticity is achieved at the desired developmental stage in a child’s life, they are more likely to have continued success in mathematics.”

Why is this true?

Well, think about it this way:

If you are trying to figure out how to factor x2-5x-24, yet couldn’t easily recall multiples of 8, you will have to spend, at the very least, twice the time on this problem as someone who could easily recall that 8x3 is 24 and -8+3 is -5.

And since math just continues to build on itself, any gaps get worse over time. Imagine you are doing a partial fractions equation, and have to first figure out the factors of the equation before moving on to the rest. If you don’t have fact fluency, you will end up wasting your brainpower on the simple aspects and get frustrated and drained when there are more and more steps.

This frustration can create the sense that you *aren’t good at math* because it takes you so much longer to solve problems than your peers and because you’re so mentally fatigued by the time you reach the end.

This is [Cognitive Load Theory](https://www.mcw.edu/-/media/MCW/Education/Academic-Affairs/OEI/Faculty-Quick-Guides/Cognitive-Load-Theory.pdf), or the idea that learners have a certain amount of “working memory” – and that in order to solve more complex problems, they need to ensure that the “simple” steps of the problem don’t rely on their working memory. To do that, those steps have to be automatic, because they’ve been internalized.

And this all comes back to your kid’s math fact fluency.

If you help your kid become fluent in their basic math facts, it will be so much easier on their brains to do harder math.

How should you do this, though?

I hate to say it, but a lot of it is really just drill-and-kill.

At the most basic level, you can have your kid do those [timed worksheets](https://math-drills.com/multiplication.php) that we remember so well (this is getting to be more and more crucial – some schools have stopped using timers on these tests because it “causes kids too much anxiety,” yet the time is what forces the automaticity and is therefore a critical part of the worksheets).

At Alpha, students use [Rocket Math](https://www.rocketmath.com/), which is likely best for younger students as it has a pretty childish interface.

Or, you can use something like [Quick Math](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/quick-maths/id1105735200) and race against your kid for the better time.

In all of these, I’d recommend some external reward (extra dessert, more screen time, a stuffed animal, movie night, etc.) for your kid because these tasks can often seem “below their level,” despite how necessary they are. For example, if they reach 40 facts per minute (1.5 seconds per fact, [the ideal for automaticity](https://www.rocketmath.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Math-Facts-research.1.pdf)), then they get their chosen reward.

Becoming fluent in math facts has the potential to transform your kid’s relationship with math forever. This could be the difference between success and failure in algebra, geometry, calculus, and more, so make sure to set your kid up for success.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Open by Andre Agassi](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Autobiography-Andre-Agassi/dp/0307388409)

This book might’ve been required reading for one of my classes, but my goodness, was it an incredible read. This autobiography literally made my eyes water and my emotions jump all over the place. It’s a fantastic story of figuring out your purpose and diving into what a “good” education would look like.

Here were two of my favorite quotes:

*I dreamed of a school with the fewest possible dry routines, a place that fostered serendipity. A place where serendipity was the norm.*

During cohort-7 of Write of Passage, David Perell constantly brought up the importance of serendipity, and he made sure to instill a sense of wonder and possibility in all of the students in regard to serendipity. The more you put yourself out there and open yourself up to new experiences, the higher likelihood you’ll have for surprise interactions and opportunities. It’s now a core value of mine – to hope for moments of serendipity and find wonder in the world around me.

*I need them for company, for counsel, and for a kind of rolling education…I study them and steal from them.*

I found this quote to particularly resonate with me because I too find myself learning from my friends and family every day. This mindset strengthens the idea that you are a combination of the five people you spend the most time with – the more time you spend with your friends, the more opportunity you have to learn from them, so make sure they’re good people.

2. [Elon Musk on how to win](https://x.com/benln/status/1845827514356175334?s=42)

After last week’s incredible SpaceX breakthrough, I thought it was only timely to talk through my favorite points of Elon’s on how to win:

* People work better when they know what the goal is and why

Although Elon is primarily referencing ensuring your team knows the goal and the “why” behind a project, it’s critical for you to know your “why” as well. Having a purpose is what helps you get through the hard times – to ensure that you don’t quit. For most high schoolers, their “why” is getting into a good college, and that motivates them to do incredible things.

* When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor

This ties back to having a “why.” If your goal is to get into a top 20 university, you might think your chances of success are only 3%. Yet you’re going to work tirelessly to increase those odds and achieve your dreams. If your “why” means enough to you, you will do anything to beat the odds.

* If you get up in the morning and think the future is going to be better, it is a bright day

It’s such a depressing trend among young people to lament about how terrible everything in the world is and how humanity is doomed. Constantly worrying about things which are not in your control is exhausting and ensures that you lead a sad life. Looking at life through an optimistic lens and remembering to practice gratitude will make you a stronger person – one who can even work towards solving those problems other people complain about.

3. [How to make a cheat sheet](https://girlknowstech.com/cheat-sheets/)

I had my first ever college exam this week!! It covered about one-third of the material in Calculus 2 (improper integrals, sequences, and series) and was genuinely so terrifying. For the exam, we were allowed a cheat sheet, which I’d never experienced before.

Thus, I, of course, began to research exactly how to make the best one to help me crush this midterm. I know some of my classmates went to high schools where they were allowed a cheat sheet – so I thought I’d link to the website I used to model my cheat sheet in case your kid has an opportunity for one. I loved this version because making it is a way to study and learn and make connections, instead of just copying down formulas.
