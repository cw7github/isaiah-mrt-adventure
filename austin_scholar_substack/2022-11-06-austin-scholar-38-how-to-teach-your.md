### **Hey, y'all!**

I don’t enjoy studying history. At all.

I still managed to ace my most recent practice US History test—but the knowledge I used to get the answers right didn’t come from my textbooks.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How Hamilton Taught Me U.S. History
2. How To Teach Your Kid History (So They’ll Actually Learn It)
3. Scholar’s Sources: My Favorite Mediums For Studying History

On Halloween, I dressed up as Elle Woods. I tried to channel my “[What, like it’s hard?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLcAQVgMTSY)” energy for the rest of the week, as we finished up the [Liftoff Sidecar program](https://writeofpassage.school/2022/09/12/our-vision-for-write-of-passage/).

Being a part of this program has reminded me that there are a ton of teenagers who are passionate about the same things I am. It’s given me such a sense of community that you can’t replicate anywhere else.

And since I’m writing this newsletter on Thursday, I haven’t seen the outcome of the World Series, but I’m definitely going to be watching to see if this [insane trend of the Phillies winning the World Series right before an economic crisis continues](https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/1585650041930268672?s=20&t=OYckyEkVfQih3Prr3aMUSw). (Baseball can apparently predict the future?!)

### Austin’s Anecdote: How Hamilton Taught Me U.S. History

As y'all know, I don't *love* history.

History textbooks are so dry, it's like they wantme to be bored.

And I have such a hard time remembering specific names and dates, which makes history tests a nightmare.

But, as I talked about in my newsletter, [The Incomplete Life of Johnson](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-28-the-incomplete), not *all* history is miserable.

For example: in 5th grade, I listened to the opening chords of "Alexander Hamilton" for the first time. Starting that very moment, I was obsessed.

Musical theater has always been a significant part of my life, ever since the catchy songs and heart-wrenching ballads of *Aladdin* sank their claws into me after I saw it on Broadway in 2nd grade.

But *Hamilton* was my first "grown-up" musical, with raps, curse words, and serious topics, making it infinitely more attractive to 5th-grade me.

Within a week, I knew every single word to every single song.

My friends and I held auditions for our own productions of *Hamilton*, where we played the karaoke tracks and wore fancy dresses. (I, of course, as an older sister, was Angelica.)

We were obsessed.

Within a few months, I could name who wrote the Bill of Rights (James Madison) and who proposed a national bank (Alexander Hamilton) at the drop of a hat. (In rhyme, too!)

A few years later, after the *Hamilton* craze died down, my voice coach gave me a new song to learn: "Heart of Stone" from the musical, *Six*.

It started again.

Soon, I was belting about King Henry VIII's six wives in my sleep, feeling empowered about what women can accomplish when I sang the finale song, "Six."

And, of course, we cannot forget my books.

During [the year I read 125 books](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-20-three-rules-for) (9th grade), I read quite a few historical fiction novels.

I was transported to 19th-century London and the role of women in the 19th century — and about one of history’s most brutal murderers — while I read *Stalking Jack the Ripper.*

I experienced the trials of Russia’s royal family and learned about their 20th-century culture and social views while I read *Romanov*.

[Billy Pilgrim's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five) fight with trauma and trying to comprehend what happened in the second World War taught me about both life during the war and life after it.

Finally, through watching movies such as *Gladiator* and *The King's Man*, I've been able to experience life as someone who lived in a different time period. I've been immersed in our Earth's story.

So, yes. From these musicals and novels and movies, I learned history.

I learned everything from the American Revolution, to the names of the first four presidents of the United States, to King Henry VIII's life and his impact on religion, to the causes and battles of World Wars I and II, to the Romanov family, to culture and life in the 19th and 20th centuries.

And let me tell you: I loved every second of it.

### How To Teach Your Kid History (So They’ll Actually Learn It)

Textbooks make kids hate history.

Worse, textbooks make history *boring*.

They present daring escapades and fantastical controversies in an academic tone. Bravery and emotion get buried under SAT words.

Brilliant people and ideas receive small paragraphs, hidden in the midst of legal jargon.

Textbooks teach kids that history is simply words on a page.

It totally misses that history was *alive*.

Musicals, such as *Hamilton*, do a better job of displaying that vibrancy than every history textbook combined.

Take, for example, Hamilton’s financial plan.

Read this excerpt from [ThoughtCo](https://www.thoughtco.com/george-washingtons-first-cabinet-4046142), a textbook-esque website:

> Hamilton had created a financial plan to deal with the major economic issues that had arisen since the end of the Revolutionary War. At that time, the federal government was in debt in the amount of $54 million (which included interest), and the states collectively owed an additional $25 million. Hamilton felt that the federal government should take over the states’ debts. To pay for these combined debts, he proposed the issuance of bonds that people could buy, which would pay interest over time. In addition, he called for the creation of a central bank to create a more stable currency.

Did any of y’all *actually* read that? Better yet, did you actually *understand* it?

Now, look at the *Hamilton* description of the plan from “Cabinet Battle #1”:

> Washington: The issue on the table, Secretary Hamilton's plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank.
>
> Jefferson: His plan would have the government assume state's debts
>
> If New York's in debt, why should Virginia bear it?
>
> Uh, our debts are paid, I'm afraid
>
> Don't tax the South 'cause we got it made in the shade.
>
> Hamilton: If we assume the debts, the union gets new line of credit, a financial diuretic
>
> How do you not get it, if we're aggressive and competitive
>
> The union gets a boost, you'd rather give it a sedative?
>
> A civics lesson from a slaver, hey neighbor
>
> Your debts are paid 'cause you don't pay for labor
>
> "We plant seeds in the South. We create." Yeah, keep ranting
>
> We know who's really doing the planting.

From this one song, I learned about what Hamilton’s plan does, why America needs it, and important figures’ opinions on the plan.

And I can recite every word on beat.

This clear discrepancy between the blandness of textbooks and the vividness of lyrics has a huge impact on remembering details in history.

Last year, when I was taking World History, I read the online textbook three times all the way through, yet I couldn’t remember the names of important figures during tests.

But a few weeks ago, I took a practice U.S. History test and I had to answer the question, “What statement describes the achievements of John Jay?”

I knew the correct answer immediately.

John Jay is a figure whose description and achievements I would’ve forgotten right after reading it.

But I can tell you what John Jay did: wrote five Federalist Papers, “defending the new United States Constitution.”

I was able to instantly recall the lyric “John Jay got sick after writing five” from “[Non-Stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPgE7PNzXag),” leading me to an answer I never would’ve remembered had it been in a paragraph in a textbook.

Thanks, *Hamilton*.

Trouble arises from the lack of true understanding of our world’s past because, as philosopher George Santayana and Winston Churchill wrote, “Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”

My dad often says that everything that is happening in the world has already happened, in one way or another.

Our generation needs to understand the past so that we may figure out how to act in the future.

But if the education system fosters an incomplete, standardized knowledge of history, how can we truly learn from it?

Well, you can teach your kid history in other ways.

Let me explain.

If your kid likes to read, buy them historical fiction novels. They’ll give your kid a glimpse into the culture and daily life of the past. (Links to book recommendations and everything else in Scholar’s Sources.)

If y’all are a movie family, watch movies about wars together. They’ll teach your kid about the values of the past and important battles that changed the course of history.

If your kid likes hands-on learning, go to art and history museums. Walk them through the cultural time periods and they’ll see how time impacted art.

If the family’s on a long car drive, listen to history podcasts together.

If your kid likes to argue, have debates on major historical events and viewpoints–and what might’ve been left out of the history books. (For more on what’s been left out of history, check out my newsletter, *[The Incomplete Life of Johnson](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-28-the-incomplete).*)

Doing those things will create a better picture of our world's story for your kid than any history textbook ever has.
