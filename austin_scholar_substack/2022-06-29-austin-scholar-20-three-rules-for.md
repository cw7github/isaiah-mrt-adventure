### **Hey, y'all!**

During my freshman year at [Alpha High](https://alphahigh.school/), I wrote an article called “I Read 125 Books in 2020.” While the writing quality left something to be desired, that article made me known as “the reader” among the Alpha community.

Because of this, I’ve been the go-to person for book recommendations for a few years now. And so, at the end of this newsletter, I will present my official book recommendation list.

But I’m getting a little ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I read 125 books in a year
2. Three rules for getting teenagers to read over the summer
3. Scholar’s Sources: My book list

This past week was my first week of summer! And yes, I have been sleeping in :)

It has been quite a busy week. Besides the work I’ve been doing with [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/), I’ve also been learning about growing on Twitter, so I went through Sahil Bloom’s [Audience Building course](https://maven.com/blake-burge-and-sahil-bloom/audience-building-4), which was so content-rich. I’m super excited to begin posting on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/AustinScholar) and should start over the next week – if you want to follow along.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I Read 125 Books In a Year

I have loved reading since, well... forever, really. Starting in elementary school, my mom has been physically taking books out of my hands to force me to stop reading and go to sleep (Sorry, mom!).

I'm definitely a fiction person. When there are fantastical worlds and twisted mysteries, why would I want to read about reality?

Becoming a different person, if only for a few hours, and being transported into a new world is always a magical experience. Reading has taken me on hundreds of incredible adventures.

Not only that, but getting a chance to love the characters and be inspired by them has made me want to work as hard as [Hermione Granger](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger) and be as good of a sister as [Beth March](https://littlewomen.fandom.com/wiki/Elizabeth_March). Reading has also made me a better person.

Always having a book in my hand is my main personality trait. I probably have over fifty books in my bedroom, and [BookPeople](https://www.bookpeople.com/) is my happy place. I'm a reader.

So, on December 31, 2019, I made a New Year's Resolution to read 125 books in 2020.

That's 2.5 books per week!

My dad had read 100 books in one year when he was a teenager, so I, obviously, had to read more than he did. Honestly, I don't really know what I was thinking. My sister thought I was actually insane.

Anyway, like most New Year's Resolutions, I expected to drop the project after a few weeks. But then, quarantine happened. Yay!

Like many others, my mental health wasn't great during the quarantine. I hated the isolation. Everything seemed horrible.

Except, of course, when I was reading.

I read So. Much. At one point, I was literally reading a book every day. I was absorbing so many stories and characters and learning what made an interesting plot and how to surprise people and how to create my own voice and so much more. I was blocking out the unfortunate reality and trading it with beautiful fiction. Reading is what got me through 2020.

And, because of my obsessive reading to avoid the negative emotions of quarantine (at least I'm self-aware?), I finished 125 books by November. Pretty cool, right?

And because I've read so much for so long, I've gathered a few of my best tips for getting teenagers to read over the summer.

### Three Rules For Getting Teenagers to Read Over the Summer

Getting teenagers to read over the summer can seem impossible, especially when there are so many distractions. When given the choice between watching TikTok or going to a party and reading a book, most teens will pick TikTok and partying.

But, you’ll be surprised how willing teenagers are to read when they are given the right content.

Here are my three rules for getting teenagers to read over the summer.

**Rule Number One: Let them read what they love to read, even if it is about crystal rituals or a murder game.**

["Read what you love until you love to read."](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002068699761659905)

In theory, this is a fantastic concept to get kids reading, and most parents are on board with it.

But when it comes into practice, a lot of parents start to struggle with implementation.

For example, over the past year, my sister got really into crystals and tarot cards and astrology. At the same time, she was having trouble staying focused in school and being productive. (If she read my newsletter, she might be a little mad at me now :) )

In order to get my sister off of TikTok and at least using her brain, my dad took her to BookPeople (my favorite Austin bookstore) and bought her whatever books she wanted.

Unsurprisingly, she came home with a bag full of books on how to do a tarot reading and interpret a birth chart and how to cleanse her crystals.

And just to be clear, my dad thinks that astrology and crystals and all of that stuff is completely ridiculous. He probably wasn't the most pleased (read: he thought it was absurd) that, of all of the possible topics, my sister wanted to read about how Aries are most compatible with Sagittarius.

But, my sister was so excited. So my dad kept his mouth shut and let her purchase her tarot cards in peace.

She spent the rest of the day holed up in her room reading her books.

No one could've guessed that my sister would voluntarily spend a weekend reading, but because she got to read about what she loved, she was happy to.

If your teenager is like my sister, here are a few of her favorites:

1. *[Love Match](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Match-Astrological-Guide-Relationships/dp/178488328X)*
2. *[The Little Book of Crystals](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Crystals-wellbeing-spiritual/dp/1856753611)*
3. *[The Cosmic Year](https://www.amazon.com/Numinous-Cosmic-Year-Astrological-Almanac/dp/1783254335)*

As for me and my favorite novels, I like a more... violent story.

One of my favorite books of all time (once you get past the politics), is called *[#murdertrending](https://www.amazon.com/MurderTrending-Gretchen-McNeil/dp/1368010024)* (the third book, *[#noescape](https://www.amazon.com/NoEscape-MurderTrending-3-Gretchen-McNeil/dp/1368026265)*, is another notable mention). It's like *The Hunger Games*, but 10 times gorier.

Let me tell you – when I start talking about how incredible these books are, my mother is Not Happy. Not that I can blame her. It can't be very exciting to have your fourteen-year-old child talking about the brilliance of an elaborate death-trap escape room.

But, after checking [Common Sense Media](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/) to make sure that I'm not reading anything *too* gruesome or graphic, she lets me talk about strategy and the style of writing and the shock and surprise on every page.

So, I continue to devour my "murder books" and maintain my love of reading.

If your teenager is like me and loves a good murder or mystery, here are a few of my favorites (My full book recommendation list will be at the end of the newsletter :) ):

1. *[#murdertrending](https://www.amazon.com/MurderTrending-Gretchen-McNeil/dp/1368010024)* & *[#noescape](https://www.amazon.com/NoEscape-MurderTrending-3-Gretchen-McNeil/dp/1368026265)*
2. *[Stalking Jack the Ripper](https://www.amazon.com/Stalking-Jack-Ripper-Kerri-Maniscalco/dp/031627349X)*
3. *[One of Us Is Lying](https://www.amazon.com/One-Us-Lying-Karen-McManus/dp/1524714682)* (I can't have *only* bloody books! And trust me, the book is so much better than the TV show.)

**Rule Number Two: Give them the** ***right kind*** **of non-fiction.**

To switch gears a little bit, let's go to non-fiction books. (And yes, while very *very* rare, I will occasionally pick up a non-fiction novel to browse through.)

My favorite non-fiction book, by far, is *[The Boston Rob Rulebook: Strategies for Life](https://www.amazon.com/Boston-Rob-Rulebook-Strategies-Life/dp/0989338622)*.

I love *[Survivor](https://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/),* and Boston Rob is the best player there is. Because of how witty and familiar his voice was, I loved the book. The Red Sox references and family stories made me smile as I read it.

Non-fiction books can be hard for a lot of teenagers to sit down and read – but that’s usually because they’re reading the wrong kind of non-fiction. A lot of people think of non-fiction as only autobiographies or pamphlets on nature.

Help your teen find non-fiction books about things they care about. Those books can be just as impactful as a novel’s magical world.

I adore Boston Rob, so I adored the book.

**Rule Number Three: Send them articles.**

And if you want to help your teen read about real-world events or more advanced topics, books can be intimidating, no matter how interesting the subject matter is.

The solution: articles.

Take a few minutes every day looking for interesting and exciting articles to send your kid on a topic that they care about.

Not only does this give them something short and specific to read, but the article can be the start of a conversation.

This is something my dad *excels* at. I don't like giving him such a big compliment, but he's seriously amazing at this.

Every day, my sister and I can expect at least one article with some important life skill or lesson wrapped up in it. And because he's read them first and he knows what we like, the articles are usually pretty interesting.

And then, every night, we'll have a super productive conversation about the article.

Bonding + Learning

(Honestly, that's probably my dad's motto.)

Reading is so valuable because it inspires conversation and knowledge. Huh, maybe my dad is onto something.

Get your kid to read over the summer because it's a chance for *both* of you to bond and learn. (Even if you learn more about the properties of crystals than you wanted.)
