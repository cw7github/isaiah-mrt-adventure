### Three steps to learn anything (& my journey to becoming an expert investor)

As I discussed in my previous newsletter, I really liked Warren Buffett’s biography – his integrity stuck out to me. I’ve never really been interested in investing, despite the fact that my dad has tried to get me into it for eighteen years. I don’t know why, it just seemed kind of scary. But when I realized Warren spent all of his time reading and researching and thinking, I thought that maybe there’s something to investing after all. Between that and my dad's insistence that investing is in fact interesting, I thought that maybe I should get an investing-related internship this summer. But given that I know nothing, I figure I should spend some time learning before condemning myself to an entire summer.

One of the key life skills that Alpha teaches kids is how to “be an expert.” We learn that in today’s AI world, it is incredibly easy to become an expert in a field you’re interested in. So, as I dig into my new interest in investing, here's the path I'm taking to become an expert:

**Step 1: Who are the existing experts?**

Starting with Warren Buffett, Perplexity Pro gave me a list of investors like him, and a list of investors who were different from him. I then had it find me the set of books about these investors and their styles that I would need to read. This covers the traditional way the “old-schoolers” learned – my dad told me about how he would go to the library and check out all of the books about Warren Buffett and investing. And I like to read, so I’m sure I’ll read a bunch of these books. But for this project, instead of just sitting down and reading the books, I'm creating an AI-enhanced learning cycle for myself.

(Here are the results from my chat with Perplexity)

**Step 2: Twitter/X**

The first thing I did was to use Grok to create a list of accounts who were experts in Warren Buffett (and the other investors I found in the previous step). I put them all into my new “investing” list, which instantly creates a highly-curated daily feed of investing information (the [very first post](https://twitter.com/QCompounding) on my feed had two writings from Charlie Munger that I should read). I would prefer to spend an hour a day reading this list, but due to my class load I will probably only get to spend thirty minutes working through this incredibly dense, specific knowledge bank – I find it five times as dense as reading a book. And when the posts trend off investing topics, I use Twitter/X’s “mute” words to filter out all of the noise and political rants. Twitter can be a cesspool of junk and spam, unless you really take advantage of this mute feature.

Here’s mine:

I don’t recommend the “For You” page (it is so easy to get off-track), instead I recommend the “Following” page and the “discovery” feature you find at the bottom of a tweet you read (new accounts and information without the distraction).

**Step 3: BrainLift**

As I read this feed, I’m going to create my “BrainLift”, which is my structured knowledge repository of my expertise and insights (the term comes from [Alpha](https://alpha.school/)). BrainLifts are important both to help me learn and to fill my brain with thoughts and facts, but they also are essential to feed to different AIs (LLMs) to help guide AIs to get the output I want.

Here’s how they work:

The first section is for the experts and their knowledge, while the second section is for my knowledge. I structure this using the [Depth of Knowledge (DOK) 1-4 framework](https://ascd.org/blogs/what-exactly-is-depth-of-knowledge-hint-its-not-a-wheel). This is well-known to those who’ve spent the last ten years with learning science and common core curriculum like me. But for those of you who don’t know what I’m talking about, here’s a quick simplification:

* DOK 1: simple facts (e.g. Warren Buffett is a value investor)
* DOK 2: summarize/synthesize an article in my own terms (e.g. based on the fact that I’ve read three articles all written a decade apart saying that Warren Buffett is too old and his strategies won’t work in the new world tells me that his ideas are timeless, yet constantly rejected by others)
* DOK 3: your own insights based on deep expertise (I’ve yet to have any of these in investing yet, so stay tuned! But in my education expertise, my insight would be that kids only need two hours a day to crush academics.)
* DOK 4: transference (in learning science lingo), which means coming up with insights that span domains (e.g. when I figure out how to build an AI bot that invests for me – also, see my article on a Personal Monopoly, “[The Sheep God of Catan](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-3-the-sheep-god-of)”)

To start with, I’m focused on DOK 1 and 2 to build my foundational knowledge (section one) which I can then use to have these insights (section two).

There are many people who think you can outsource thinking to Google and AI, rather than filling your brain with facts, but I’ve found that if you want to have insights and ideas at the DOK 3 and 4 level, they come because you have a rich knowledge tree of DOK 1 and 2. So alas, I need to really focus on all of the very basic facts of investing if I ever want to truly become an expert and have interesting ideas around it.

As I’m reading my daily feed, I come across ideas and concepts that I will summarize into my BrainLift (like those two articles from Charlie Munger from my list, [The Art of Stock Picking](https://www.grahamanddoddsville.net/wordpress/Files/Gurus/Charlie%20Munger/Charlie%20Munger%20_%20Art%20of%20Stock%20Picking.pdf) and [The Psychology of Human Misjudgement](https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/psychology-of-human-misjudgment-by-charlie-munger)). My sister’s BrainLift on teen dating is over 100 pages long and filled with articles and papers that she’s researched and summarized.

During the month of January, I’ll spend most of my time on this DOK 1 and 2 strategy. However, I expect that I’ll have ideas about investing that come to me as I read. I will write them in the terms of a [spiky POV](https://www.weskao.com/blog/spiky-point-of-view-lets-get-a-little-controversial). For example, in reading the Warren Buffett book along with Warren’s favorite two chapters of Intelligent Investor, I had the following idea: for a risk averse, super logical math-oriented person like myself, the key skill that I would struggle with is figuring out how to have enough conviction to make a large contrarian bet when Mr. Market is saying something completely different.

Experience has taught me, though, that since I’ll only be a month in, that most of these will be wrong. (This whole process relates to the “young kids think they know everything about a topic but they actually know nothing.”)

At Alpha High, we called this first month of BrainLift building the “explore” stage, where we’re spending up to an hour a day reading things we think we’re interested in and summarizing and synthesizing knowledge. There’s a lot more to becoming an expert (like my favorite, writing, and my least favorite, DMing and meeting experts and actually doing it, not just learning it – i.e. creating an investment portfolio. Note – for people who aren’t as risk averse as I am (like my sister) creating an investment portfolio might be a great first step to engage their interests), but by the end of the month, I’ll know whether this topic genuinely engages me and excites me, or if I find this a slog. Wait for the update in February to know whether I’m still on this path :)

So, to recap: if you want to learn any topic, start with these three steps:

1. Find the existing experts (ask Perplexity “Who are the most established experts in X?” and read about them)
2. Create a curated feed (ask Grok for a list of accounts about your topic and your experts, create a list with them, and spend thirty minutes per day engaging with the content)
3. Create your BrainLift (start by finding and learning the common facts, then move on to summarizing and synthesizing content by experts, and finally begin to form your own spiky POVs)

Your kid can do this for any topic they’re interested in – music, teen dating, mental health, religion, fashion design… as long as they’re willing to put in the work, they’ll become an expert in no time.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Garry Tan’s post](https://x.com/garrytan/status/1872486083667349610)

Garry Tan, the CEO of Y-Combinator, agreed that in the next decade, we can “give every American child a personal AI tutor for all technical subjects (math, science, physics, engineering) from a young age and we will be drowning in talent to build anything we can dream up.”

The foremost innovators and participants in AI agree with our message – AI can change the future of education and can allow every single kid to reach their full potential.

And it’s not just in the next ten years – it’s already happening at Alpha.

2. Spoiler alert: [learning science helps students learn better](https://marylandmatters.org/2025/01/02/what-happens-when-a-school-district-commits-to-the-science-of-learning/)

I’ve talked about learning science a lot, and I’m happy to report that it’s been proven to work! One school district started teaching exclusively with learning science techniques (direct instruction, mastery, etc.) and saw incredible results:

“Over five years since implementing the changes, middle school math students’ benchmark assessments have grown, in some schools by as much as 20%, especially among students of color and English learners. Over the same five-year period across the state of Maryland, students of color and English learners’ math proficiency [as measured on the state exam](https://reportcard.msde.maryland.gov/Graphs/#/ReportCards/ReportCardSchool/1/E/1/99/XXXX/2023) has declined.”

3. [AI tools](https://x.com/deedydas/status/1874485749791510592) you should be using

There’s always so much information around different AI apps and tools, so I thought I’d include this great summarization of the tools you can use to superpower your life:
