### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. How your kid can design their dream life
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

I’ve been feeling great recently. With spring break coming up and my overall prepared-ness for my finals, I feel both excited for the upcoming weeks and content with where I am now. This is a far cry from the first half of this quarter, where I was constantly stressing about my exams and how far behind I felt.

What changed?

I’ve been getting eight hours of sleep each night, exercising multiple times per week (including pilates in my dorm room, walking a few miles around campus, and yoga routines), and studying for my Math 51 exam a little bit each day instead of all at once two days before. Small, basic changes really do the most.

I’ve also been locked in on a few TV shows, which I’ve found to have become a fundamentally social activity for me – I don’t really watch shows without other people. Instead, I’m watching Severance every Thursday with one of my best friends, Mythic Quest with my family, and White Lotus every Sunday with a group chat recap with some close family friends. It’s a great way to connect with people even when you don’t have a lot of energy (a constant state of mine at the end of each day). I couldn’t recommend having a “family show” more – it will make everyone excited to spend time together and ensures that a least a little time each week is spent together.

### How your kid can design their dream life

Two years ago, I [wrote](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-47-life-advice-from) an article about my favorite ideas from Sahil Bloom and translated them to be more applicable to kids. He then responded to my thread about that article with this, which basically cemented my love for his ideas and my hope that I was on the right track with my content:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cnrj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F619d5fda-b90d-45c5-9ac6-fd357ea7a441_960x180.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cnrj!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F619d5fda-b90d-45c5-9ac6-fd357ea7a441_960x180.png)

So when Sahil published his book, *The 5 Types of Wealth*, earlier this year, I knew my time had come to yet again become Sahil’s teenage translation engine :)

His book is about designing your dream life, something that could not be more applicable to kids, and to teenagers in particular. I mean, that’s literally the entire point of being a teenager – trying to figure out who you are and what you want out of life.

It would be super hard to talk about every incredible concept in his book (you should [buy it yourself](https://www.amazon.com/Types-Wealth-Transformative-Guide-Design/dp/059372318X) to get the maximum amount of value!!), so I’ll cut it down to what I think were the most valuable thought experiments and exercises for your kid.

In the book, Sahil argues that there are five pillars of wealth: time, social, mental, physical, and financial. In this issue, I’ll broadly explain each one and then include one or two exercises your kid can do to transform the way they think about each pillar. In the next, I’ll share some more parenting-focused exercises and concepts from *The 5 Types of Wealth*.

**Time wealth**: “The freedom to choose how to spend your time, whom to spend it with, where to spend it, and when to trade it for something else” (25).

1. The energy calendar

The premise of this exercise is simple: you want to find the activities in your life that give you energy and do more of them, and find the activities that drain your energy and do less of them.

Your task: spend one week rating every activity you do on a green, yellow, and red scale. Green activities give you energy, yellow activities are neutral, and red activities drain energy. Don’t think too deeply about your responses – go with your gut feeling. Here is mine from a few weeks ago:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AT31!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb4f909b-7b75-4bdb-8d60-4572c82450d7_1332x956.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AT31!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb4f909b-7b75-4bdb-8d60-4572c82450d7_1332x956.png)

(I used orange instead of yellow to differentiate from my class schedule.)

Some trends I noticed (ignore my midterm crash out – that was a bit of an anomaly): the one-on-one tutoring and individual studying were significantly better for me than the group review sessions, so for the final, I should think about not going to those and instead going to office hours or learning on my own.

On Tuesday, scrolling on TikTok after working on my short story was a neutral activity, while watching TV with my friends after our midterm was energizing for me. So I should definitely consider making my decompression time after a long day more social. And, of course, everything related to my newsletter was energizing :)

The goal is to figure out the parts of your life that drain your energy and figure out ways to improve them. Of course, it’s often impossible for students to “improve” energy draining activities like awful homework worksheets or essays about things you don’t care about, but there are things you can do to give yourself energy. Try having an energizing activity right after a long homework session – like dinner with your friends or watching a show with your family. Or maybe reward yourself for completing the homework with a nice dessert or an extra episode of TV that night.

2. The anti-procrastination system

Procrastination plagues millions of teens every year. But there is a way to work around it.

Step 1: Deconstruct the task – break it down to its smallest parts (ex. I have to write the introduction, research, write an article, find sources, and write the sources every week for my newsletter)

Step 2: Plan and create stakes – plan exactly what you’re going to do and use social pressure and rewards to motivate yourself (ex. I’m meeting up with my friend today at 2pm to write my newsletter introduction for fifteen minutes and find my sources for fifteen minutes. Once I do that, we can catch up for a half hour.)

Step 3: Action – follow through on your plan

That is, of course, the hardest part. But by using social pressure and making plans with other people who can hold you accountable, you are definitely helping yourself get started.

This is why I always love studying with other friends who also have stuff they need to get done. We can support each other and reward ourselves by talking to each other (something that is very motivating, especially when I have lots of life updates).

**Social wealth**: “The depth and breadth of your connection to those around you. It is the network you can rely on for love and friendship but also for help in times of need” (26).

Every single exercise in this section is an absolute banger and particularly applicable to kids navigating relationships for the first time, but this was my favorite thought exercise in this section:

1. Your front row people

Close your eyes and take three deep breaths. Imagine you’re at your graduation. Who is there for you? Who is sitting in the front row, screaming their heads off as you accept your diploma? Imagine their faces. These people–your Front-Row People–are the ones who truly matter.

Your relationships will change *so much* as you grow up – friends come together, grow apart, reconnect, and fight over and over again. And that’s okay – your Front-Row People can change by the day. But what matters is that you’re letting those people know how much they mean to you. Ask yourself:

*What are you doing to cherish the people who hold those special seats in your world?*

*How are you letting those people know what they mean to you?*

*Are you prioritizing time with them?* (pg. 131)

Take one small action every day to show these people that you care about them – give them a hug, hold the door open for them, bring them Starbucks, text them so they know you’re thinking of them, send them a TikTok…anything to make sure they know that you love them.

It can be super hard navigating changing relationships and emotions throughout middle and high school, but focusing on ensuring you have a strong foundation with your Front-Row People can make it ten times easier.

**Mental wealth**: “The connection to a higher-order purpose and meaning that provides motivation and guides your decision making. It is grounded in a pursuit of growth and embraces the dynamic potential of your intelligence, ability, and character and an engagement in lifelong learning and development” (26).

I’ve actually written about most of the exercises and concepts Sahil talks about in the mental wealth section (Ikigai, the forgetting curve, spaced repetition, growth mindset), but there was one that particularly stuck out to me: the power walk. I feel that most people (especially kids) underestimate the beauty of walking, despite the many scientifically-proven advantages (higher test scores, improved memory, increased connection, etc.). Here are ways you can incorporate walking into your life:

* Essay outlining walks (instead of writing down the outline for your essay or project, use a tool like Otter and walk and talk! Walking will improve your creativity and spark super interesting ideas while you get exercise.)
* Family walks on the weekend (spend time talking about your weeks and enjoy the outside)
* The angry walk (if you’re mad at your parents, instead of yelling or fighting or retreating to your room, go on a walk and work through what’s making you angry. I always have fun on these walks – even though now I don’t get mad at my parents that often, I do this when I’m frustrated with my friends or a professor and get the same results)

**Physical wealth**: “A focus on the controllable actions around movement, nutrition, and recovery and the creation of consistent habits to promote vigor” (27).

My dad has always told me that although young people have more leeway in terms of making healthy choices, you don’t want to create bad habits that continue into adulthood. And recently, improving my physical health has absolutely been a focus of mine–although improving my diet has proved to be challenging as Stanford dining hall foods were [reported](https://stanforddaily.com/2025/02/11/report-finds-high-levels-of-plastic-chemicals-in-dining-hall-food/) to have the highest level of microplastics of any foods in the Bay Area and the rest of the campus is littered with fast-food restaurants. However, the other two pieces of physical wealth that Sahil talks about are absolutely applicable to me personally (and things I talked about in my update!): exercise and sleep.

If your kid isn’t involved in club activities or other forms of exercise throughout the week, they can start small with the 5-5-5-30 exercise, where you do five squats, five push-ups, five lunges, and a thirty second plank soon after you wake up. This won’t change your life, but it will ensure that you’re starting your day with a little bit of exercise. This could also be something good to do while studying or if you’ve been sitting in a chair listening to a teacher lecture for, say, eight hours straight.

As for sleep, I talk about exercises you can do to improve sleep (which are super similar to Sahil’s tips) in this [article](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-10-let-teenagers-take).

**Financial wealth**: “Financial assets minus financial liabilities…with your liabilities including your expectations of what you need, your definition of enough” (27).

The two core tenets of generating income that Sahil discusses are building skills and leveraging skills – two things that you can help your kid learn young.

A ton of parents give their kids an allowance for completing a set of chores, but what about the other skills they can learn? Consider offering your kid a pay raise if they start, say, taking over bedtime stories and reading to their younger sibling or baking cookies for the entire family at the end of a week. What are skills your kid is potentially interested in that you can help them cultivate? The possibilities are endless – stitching up clothes, planting flowers, making dinner, coding a website to track chores, helping their sibling with their homework, creating posters for family movie night.

Allow your kid to build skills that they can then leverage to get an increased allowance or, maybe, sell to the general public.

If you found any part of this interesting, I *highly* recommend buying *The 5 Types of Wealth* for yourself. Sahil includes so many engaging anecdotes and a ton of other great exercises, so it’s definitely worth the purchase.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. Why textbooks usually suck

A few weeks ago, I [wrote](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-144-why-your-kid-loves) about Ausubel’s article on meaningful learning. In the essay, Ausubel explains that your existing knowledge can be thought of as schemas in your long-term memory.

A "schema" is a package of logic or knowledge that helps you understand how part of the world works. Each schema has "branches" or "hooks" that related knowledge can hang on.

However, many textbooks tend to throw all of the information at you at once. In my math textbook, for instance, the first page has the basic formula, but the very next has three different exceptions to that formula and the page after that has some crazy-complicated examples. So in my very first introduction to the topic, I have to create a schema with twenty different branches with examples attached to each one. That is extremely hard to digest and frequently leads to confusion – which branch was this example attached to? How many branches does this schema have?

On the other hand, once you understand the basic material, the exceptions become the most interesting part, not the most annoying part. While experts actively look for anomalies, novices need the basics. So if your kid is extra confused about a chapter in their textbook, have them only talk through and try to understand the basic formula – just the first page. Then, once they’ve mastered that and complete the simple examples with ease, they can move to pages two and three.

2. [Milton Friedman’s](https://www.amazon.com/Capitalism-Freedom-Anniversary-Milton-Friedman/dp/0226264211) *[Capitalism and Freedom](https://www.amazon.com/Capitalism-Freedom-Anniversary-Milton-Friedman/dp/0226264211)*[, chapter 10](https://www.amazon.com/Capitalism-Freedom-Anniversary-Milton-Friedman/dp/0226264211)

For my COLLEGE 102 (Citizenship in the 21st century) class this week, we read about capitalism and inequality, a very contentious topic in today’s economy. Despite the fact that my sister has been obsessed with Milton Friedman for years and has listened to every single one of his books, I never got into it and just decided to trust her that he was a great thinker, but now I wish I’d started reading his work earlier. Our readings were extremely thought-provoking and Friedman directly interacted with and challenged Marxist thought throughout. His engagement with the opposition and takedown of their arguments was genuinely fascinating.

Here’s an example of that in chapter 10 of *Capitalism and Freedom*:

According to Friedman, Marxists argue that workers are unfairly treated because they don’t get the full value of the things they create.

Friedman doesn’t even try to validate that argument. Instead, he immediately explains how Marx’s argument is wrong because:

* Marx mixes up the total value created by all resources with the value created by workers alone.
* Marx treats tools and machines as just "past labor," ignoring their unique contribution to production.

He then includes clear examples and logical patterns of thought. Whether you agree with his philosophy or not, Friedman is truly a fantastic debater and thinker – one whose strategies of argument I definitely want to copy.

3. [Opennote](https://opennote.me/)

I found out about Opennote from [this](https://x.com/RayFernando1337/status/1893167812996419968) X post. I love when students create for other students, so I had to check it out. I immediately became hooked.

Once concept I’m struggling with in my linear algebra-multivariable calculus duo-torture class is QR decomposition (if you don’t know what that is, count yourself lucky), and I decided to throw Opennote right into the deep end to see if it could help me out. And help me it did.

Not only did the AI explain the concept extremely clearly (better than my textbook, for sure), but it also came up with a list of resources I could use to learn more and further questions I could ask to deepen my understanding. And the best part: it came up with its own examples!! For me, Opennote was hugely useful and I highly recommend checking it out when there’s a concept you want to dive deeper into.
