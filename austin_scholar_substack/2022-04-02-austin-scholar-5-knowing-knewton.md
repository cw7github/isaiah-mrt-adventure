### **Hey, y'all!**

Welcome back to the Austin Scholar newsletter! At the time I sent out this newsletter, I was still working on getting my Substack reinstated, but that did not hinder my writing. I continued to send weekly newsletters from Austin Scholar, and now that I am sixteen I am able to re-publish those newsletters onto Substack. Apologies for the inconvenience and I thank you for your support and patience.

Today from Austin Scholar...

### Austin’s Anecdote

Although I expect to get a 5 on my Calculus BC AP test in a couple of months, learning and understanding math concepts has always been a challenge for me. I am not one of the naturally genius kids who can understand how to calculate complex derivatives after a couple minutes of studying. In third grade, one of the other students in my class got called out by the teacher for “already doing Algebra,” while I was still mastering my twelves times tables. The two of us were constantly compared in class, with my classmate usually coming out on top. I was really frustrated because I had been spending extra time working on my homework and trying to get ahead in classes.

But then, I switched schools and started using exclusively online apps to learn math. I began to spend hours every day working through the apps, fueled by my past frustrations. Even though I wasn’t even at the same school as my old classmate, I always felt like I had to catch up to him. Because I spent so much time in math, I was able to complete multiple years of math in one school year and reach the 99th percentile in math nationwide.

Before I started high school, I was surprised to hear that my old classmate would be joining Alpha. The first day back, I realized that, because he continued going to a standard school and didn’t use apps, he had only been able to complete one year of math per school year. Now *he* had to catch up to *me*.

If you have a kid, regardless of their supposed math skills, who wants to accelerate in math, using adaptive apps is a great way to go.

The number one app I can attribute my growth in math to is called [Knewton Alta](https://www.knewton.com/login?r=%2F), so I thought I would give a deep-dive into one of my personal favorites.

### Knowing Knewton: Austin's App Analysis

Three years ago, I used [Knewton Alta](https://www.knewton.com/login?r=%2F) for the first time as I started my journey in learning Algebra I. The first few months of learning how to navigate Knewton were filled with red "incorrect" banners and screaming matches with my computer as I tried to learn the way to get the most value out of Knewton. Since my first sprint in Algebra I, I have taken four other Knewton courses in math and science (Algebra II, PreCalculus, Chemistry I, and Chemistry II), which cemented my knowledge in using the app. This series, Austin's App Analysis, aims to give a comprehensive "How–To" for understanding a few of my favorite adaptive apps.

### Overview

While not as well known as Khan Academy, I find Knewton to be a more rigorous course and more effective at ensuring that the students are mastering the content.

> **Comprehensiveness: 9/10**
>
> Comprehensiveness measures the app's ability to cover all of the necessary content in a course. Each of Knewton's courses contains seemingly endless lessons and learning objectives that teach almost every single topic in that learning track.
>
> **Adaptability: 5/10**
>
> Adaptability measures how well the app adjusts the content shown to a student based on what that student knows. While in each individual lesson, a student must answer about four questions correctly in a row to move on from a topic, the overall course is not adaptable as there is no way to test out of content. The number of lessons is fixed.
>
> **Place in Sequence: 1st App**
>
> Inmy second newsletter, I explained the importance of sequencing apps, or completing multiple apps for each course. As Knewton scores high in Comprehensiveness and low in Adaptability, it is a perfect first app.
>
> **#1 Weakness:**
>
> As Knewton is lacking in the overall adaptability in each course, the most frustrating part of Knewton is the inability to test out of content at the beginning of the course. Because of this, the first few lessons in each course can be a waste of time.
>
> **#1 Strength:**
>
> The most valuable aspect of Knewton is the explanations. Not only does Knewton provide both written AND video explanations for each overall topic, but the app also has an explanation for EVERY problem provided. The explanations strengthen the comprehensiveness of the app.

### Working the Program

##### (If you’re not a student, feel free to jump to “What Do I Do When I’m Stuck?”)

When first logging onto Knewton, taking a moment to look over the entire course and gaining a quick understanding of the topics that are going to be covered can help with figuring out daily goals for the course. For example, it took me about one hour to complete one Knewton lesson (~4 learning objectives), so if I wanted to complete ten lessons per week, I needed to spend two hours per day in Knewton.

*Above: Overview of Knewton's Algebra II Course*

Clicking on a lesson provides an overview of the learning objectives that will be covered in the lesson. Each objective requires four correct answers in a row to complete. Also shown in the lesson overview are two buttons next to each learning objective. The first button (looks like a progress bar) shows the questions that have been asked in that learning objective. The second button (looks like pages) contains a written explanation of the learning objective. This written explanation is also provided during the lesson as needed.

*Above: Example Knewton Question (See Close Proximity of "More Instruction" and "Submit")*

*﻿*If the question is confusing or displays an unknown concept, a "More Instruction" button is provided. "More Instruction" typically provides a written explanation (also accessible in the lesson overview) for the concept. One important note is that clicking "More Instruction" does not move the lesson forward OR backward. Progress is not lost by clicking the button.

**WARNING: THE "MORE INSTRUCTION" BUTTON IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE "SUBMIT" BUTTON. CAREFUL CLICKING.**

*Above: "More Instruction" Pop-Up*

Knewton's written explanations are incredibly helpful. First, an overview of the concept is provided with key terms highlighted. Second, direct examples are provided. These examples almost always correspond to the exact questions asked.

*Above: Incorrect Knewton Question + Step-By-Step Explanation*

Knewton also provides video explanations! If the written version doesn't click, after either missing multiple questions or clicking on "More Instruction" twice, a video explanation will be shown. The video also includes both the overall concept explanation and individual examples.

### What Do I Do If I’m Stuck?

> The number one question or worry of students and parents when using apps is “What do I do if I get stuck and there isn’t a teacher to ask for help?”
>
> For math, here is the 3 step “unstick” plan.

1. Review the written explanations and watch the videos the app provides. (Click the Help Button)
2. [Brainly.com](http://brainly.com/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) videos, and[WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) are great math-help-resources (See “Scholar’s Sources” for more information).
3. Finally, simply Google the learning objective to access numerous resources, websites, and videos on how to solve that type of problem.

### One Last Tip For Teens:

> **Put effort into the course.** Speeding through the content and skipping around in the course will not lead to an understanding and mastery of the content. I promise, this WILL backfire when the not-totally-learned content appears in later courses and questions and you have to go back and actually learn the concepts to move forward in the more challenging course. **Take notes, read the explanations, and sit down and work. Results will come.**

[Brainly](https://brainly.com/) is a great online forum and resource that allows you to ask a question (Explain this concept, How do I solve this problem, etc.) and a verified expert will provide an explanation within minutes. By getting an account, you can interact with other students across America. Brainly is basically a virtual study group. I highly recommend checking it out.

[Khan Academy videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy) are probably the most famous online resource for homework help in America. In my experience, though, rather than helping with specific problem types, these videos are more useful in explaining the overall concept of a problem. When looking for math help, first go to the Khan Academy Youtube channel and find the video playlist that aligns with the target learning objective and try watching a few of the videos. If the particular problem is still confusing after that, going to Brainly or WolframAlpha can help in understanding the specifics of the problem.

[WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) is one of the most helpful tools on the internet for additional explanations. This website provides charts and graphs to go along with its clear and informative written explanations. WolframAlpha can give an explanation for basically any math problem, give data for most science and history concepts, and even give a comparison of stocks. Though the step-by-step feature is only unlocked through the paid version, most graphs and other properties are completely free and are a great help in understanding the overall objective and purpose. Side note: these explanations are so high quality that [Outlier](https://www.outlier.org/), a new online app that has the “world’s best for-credit university-level courses,” links directly to WolframAlpha when students need more help.
