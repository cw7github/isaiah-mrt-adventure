### **Hey, y'all!**

AI is taking over the writing world, and everyone is freaking out.

If AI can write better essays than the average high school student, then what good is learning to write at all? What does [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) mean for education?

Well, AI is only taking over the boring writing. The good writing–the distinctly human stuff–can't be replicated by a robot.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I Learned What Writing Is Supposed to Be
2. How to Help Kids Write Better Than ChatGPT
3. Scholar’s Sources: My Favorite Threads on Utilizing ChatGPT’s Potential

It’s been a crazy week. Steven Strogatz, the author of my actual favorite book ([Infinite Powers](https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Powers-Calculus-Language-Universe/dp/1786492946)), liked one of my tweets. It was probably the best day of my life. I’ve been driving a lot, as well (getting on highways is not something my mom enjoys watching me do).

I've also been going through a Twitter course and have been posting on Twitter multiple times a day. If you haven't seen it yet, you can check that out [here](https://twitter.com/AustinScholar).

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I Learned What Writing Is Supposed to Be

I've *mastered* the five-paragraph, third-person observational essay.

I know the sentence structure required, number of SAT words needed, and types of arguments that will get me an A. Last year, before the AP Language and Composition exam, I created and memorized super specific templates for every essay (complete with pre-written sentences, prompting words, and examples) so I would only need to fill in the question specific-details on exam-day.

I got a five.

But let me be completely clear: no one would actually *want* to read those essays.

They're too boring, academic, and formulaic for people to actually enjoy reading them.

Besides, *anyone* could've written those essays. To those AP graders, I was just another faceless, nameless student who happened to write something of high quality. Or even worse–I was just another essay on rhetorical devices.

That's the problem with educational writing. There's nothing distinctive about it.

To get a good grade, I had to write in a specific form in a specific tone with specific arguments.

But in all honesty, that's not good writing.

Good writing comes alive with personality–you *know* who wrote that sentence.

That's something I really struggled with when I first started writing these newsletters. I was stuck in a "school mindset." I tried to use fancy words and keep my arguments objective.

But that made my writing pretty bland. The "school mindset" really hurt my writing. I got a lot feedback from my parents and readers on how my writing wasn't personal enough–but I really didn't understand why.

My writing would've gotten me a good grade, so why don't people like it?

And then, during a [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/) live session, [David Perell](https://perell.com/) edited an article about pancakes.

The first part of the essay was a super informational recipe on how to make healthy, vegan pancakes. I suppose a certain audience would enjoy it, but as a non-vegan, I'm not a part of it.

But the second half of the essay was about the author's interactions with her kids when she makes the pancakes. I loved it. This part of the essay was relatable, heartwarming, and funny–even to someone who doesn't care about vegan pancakes.

It clicked.

It's truly the personality that makes writing sing. The arguments and evidence might be the rhythm, but it's the stories that are the melodies.

And so, I had to unlearn my habits of removing myself from my writing. Instead, I had to immerse myself in it.

I practiced being vulnerable and baring my soul and making jokes.

I learned to put myself on the page.

### How to Help Kids Write Better Than ChatGPT

The whole world is abuzz talking about [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat): the revolutionary chatbot that can explain complex topics, create Twitter hooks, and write an essay on any topic that can’t be flagged for plagiarism.

It’s true. ChatGPT provides an insanely easy way for students to cheat–without getting caught. I have no doubt that there are thousands of kids who have already turned in A+ papers without writing a single word–and no one could tell.

So, what does that mean for writing, and education in general?

If ChatGPT can write an essay on Shakespeare indistinguishable from the best student in English class, what’s the point?

In spite of its real-world irrelevance, I do think that there are benefits to the five-paragraph essay. Kids learn how to structure arguments, learn basic grammar and word choice, and begin exploring nuances in writing.

The classic essay is a great baseline for students to learn how to write–but it shouldn’t be the end goal. ChatGPT proves that *just* writing these essays isn’t enough. It’s not valuable anymore.

If teenagers don’t improve past the five-paragraph essay, their writing skills are essentially useless in the new world of AI and ChatGPT.

So, how do we fix this?

We have to change how we teach writing.

High school English classes are worthless if the ideal is to perfect essay-writing skills. AI has that covered. But, what if the goal of learning to write was to captivate people with unique perspectives and personalities?

Instead of churning out indistinguishable essay-writers, we would create individual storytellers.

We need to teach high schoolers to write something *only they can write*.

There are two frameworks that can help teach kids how to write something more valuable than what ChatGPT can: [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/)’s POP Writing and my Sheep God Principle.

**POP Writing**

POP writing was pretty much a life-changing concept for me.

For ten years, objective arguments and academic tones had been beaten into my mind. I had to write that boring essay with too many words that I didn’t actually know the definition of. The essay that blurred together with every other essay on *Hamlet*. That faded into oblivion.

But when I took Write of Passage, they wanted the opposite.

They wanted those stories I thought were silly and those weird connections only I could make.

They wanted my writing to POP.

Personal, Observational, and Playful.

The most relatable writing is filled with personal experiences and moments of vulnerability. It’s writing that is infused with personality.

The most valuable writing has observations and insights about the world that no one else sees.

The most engaging writing makes people smile–or ponder your word choice. The comparisons and metaphors and paradoxes are what make people remember what you had to say.

And you know what? Writing balanced with heartfelt stories, unique insights, and absurd comparisons can’t be beaten by ChatGPT.

**The Sheep God Principle**

One of the very first articles I ever wrote as Austin Scholar is titled, *[The Sheep God of Catan](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-3-the-sheep-god-of)*. In the newsletter, I explain how my unique [Catan](https://www.catan.com/) strategy allowed me to crush my friends–and how you can use the strategy to be successful in the real world, too.

Basically, in each game, while the other players fought over brick and lumber (the popular items), I worked to become the sole player with sheep. And when the rest of the players needed sheep to continue building, they could only turn to me. I was in control of all the sheep in the game. I was a Sheep God.

And just as it is pretty much impossible to win the battle of brick and lumber in Catan, it’s super challenging to be the world’s best essay writer–something hundreds of thousands of Ph.D. students and English majors fight over.

This is where being a Sheep God comes in. Combining your interests, skills, and personal stories in a unique way (and going against the grain) allows you to be the best in the world in whatever you’re writing–way better than ChatGPT.

It’s not that *all* writing is being replaced by ChatGPT. The copy-paste English essays will always be beaten by AI. But personal, story-filled writing with a unique perspective? That’s not going anywhere–at least not anytime soon.
