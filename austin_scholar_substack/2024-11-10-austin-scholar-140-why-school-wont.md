### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I got a 1600 SAT score
2. Why school won’t help your kid get better test scores
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

Another week at Stanford University has passed, and it’s still as crazy as all of the weeks before. Along with writing a 4,000 word essay and reading two books for class, I also had my second math midterm on Thursday. It’s shocking: my academically rigorous university is, in fact, academically rigorous.

On a personal level, I’ve really been trying to keep up with my friends from home, but I realized that for all of them except for one, we don’t talk unless *I* call them first. I know they’re busy and they still care about me, but it was still a hard thing to recognize.

Overall, though, we’re ⅔ of the way through with my first quarter at Stanford and all I can say is that it’s been a whirlwind.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I got a 1600 SAT score

This week’s article (see below!) is primarily focused on strategies to improve standardized test scores, so I thought I’d share a few personal tips on how I studied to get [a 1600 on the SAT](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-94-how-i-got-a-1600).

1. Practice *timed* tests

The time on the SAT was always my biggest problem – I would get stressed out about it and rush through passages or problems and make silly mistakes that I otherwise wouldn’t have.

So it was critical that a large portion of my study time was spent practicing the time aspect of the test. I would set a timer for my goal time (10 minutes per passage for the old SAT; for the new SAT, there’s 32 minutes to complete 27 questions, so aim for one minute per question).

Daily repetitions of one or two timed passages will help get you used to the timed aspect of the exam.

2. Targeted IXL lessons

Along with the daily practice, I took a few full practice tests. After each one, I went through the questions I got wrong and map them to an [IXL](https://www.ixl.com/) lesson that I could use to refresh my memory (for things I didn’t know) or get better at not making careless mistakes (for things I should’ve gotten right).

IXL has a section for [SAT Skill Plans](https://www.ixl.com/math/skill-plans/sat-math), where you can see which skills are aligned with each IXL lesson in both the math and the reading and writing sections.

3. Formula sheets

There always seemed to be a few equations that I would get mixed up or forget how to apply, and I found myself wishing they were on the given formula sheet.

So I decided to make my own.

I wrote out everything I would’ve wanted on a formula sheet in the exam and used that as my main study material. It can seem super overwhelming when you don’t know what to study for the exam, so limiting it to one formula sheet can be super helpful.

I ended up writing the formula sheet a few times, too, so that I could get the equations in muscle memory if all else failed.

I know that a lot of students have begun preparing for the spring SAT exams right now, so I just want to wish you all luck and invite you to reach out if you have any questions on study aids for specific problems you’re having!!

### Why school won’t help your kid get better test scores

It’s time to accept the harsh truth: school won’t help your kid get better test scores.

In 2022, the average fourth and eighth graders were not proficient in math, [according to NAEP](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/mathematics/nation/scores/?grade=4). (This isn’t a COVID trend – the average scores have been below proficient since the tests’ creation in 1990.)

And it’s not even that the standards are incredibly high, either. Students who are proficient in mathematics at the fourth grade level can, for example, “understand the relationships between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.” For eighth graders, they should be able to solve Pythagorean Theorem problems – that is, a^2 + b^2 = c^2. That’s it.

The average eighth grader in America cannot solve Pythagorean Theorem problems, and I have to wonder if it’s because the average fourth grader hasn’t mastered relationships between the four basic operations.

And therein lies the biggest problem with traditional classrooms – the curriculum is standardized. The first class in fifth grade math classrooms covers one topic, and they’ve moved onto the second topic by the next class, even if students haven’t learned the content.

And this happens at the grade level, too. Students who score an 80% on the final exam are still missing 20% of content mastery, but they’re moved onto the next grade with a “good job!” But in the next grade level, they’re covering something harder that builds on the concepts that they didn’t understand in the previous grade level, and so on.

This is how knowledge gaps are created – and when it comes time to take standardized tests, these gaps make themselves evident.

Unfortunately, though, classrooms can’t go back to previous grade levels or topics to catch kids up and fill their knowledge gaps. Because of this, kids end up in a doom loop, where they don’t understand the content on the exam, but their classes can’t help them re-learn the foundational concepts.

Fortunately, it’s not hopeless for your kid. A group of middle school students at [Alpha School](https://alpha.school/) took the ISEE exam two months ago and tested into the 49th percentile. Last week, they scored in the 73rd percentile. That’s a 50% increase. In two months.

How? Online, adaptive, AI-powered apps. The apps create personalized learning plans for each student that allow them to fill in the knowledge gaps that a traditional classroom wouldn’t.

These students did a “Blitz” where they did, on average, one hour of work in [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/) and [Piqosity](https://www.piqosity.com/isee-upper-level/) Monday-Friday for two months. One hour per day was all it took.

Of course, with classes and homework and extracurriculars, your kid likely doesn’t have time to do an extra hour of online app work to improve their standardized test scores. But you can start with just 30 minutes, and you can check out [this newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-130-how-and-why-to) where I outlined how to use Math Academy to put together a plan for your kid.

Try out 30 minutes a day for four months. Motivate your kid by promising a [Chick-Fil-A dinner](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-124-how-a-chick-fil), extra screen time over the weekend, a sleepover, or something else similar for every week they complete their online app work.

Let your kid show you how much they’re capable of when they’re given the right tools.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [The inning that will haunt the Yankees forever](https://x.com/Jomboy_/status/1852513509717811642)

Game 5 of the 2024 World Series had the biggest meltdown I’ve ever seen in baseball. By the fifth inning, the Yankees were up 5-0 and I was already preemptively mourning the Dodgers’ win in the game and explaining to everyone how they’d still be okay when they go back to LA. And then disaster struck for the Yankees: fielding errors, an uncovered first base, and a fighting spirit from the Dodgers led to closing out the inning at 5-5. I honestly stared at the laptop all of my friends had crowded around with my jaw on the floor. I think I was in shock during the entire inning, so I watched this excellent breakdown of the inning to relive the experience and understand where the Yankees went wrong. Even if you don’t care about the Yankees or Dodgers, I’d recommend checking out this video – it’s a great example of baseball analytics and is super enjoyable to watch :)

Practically speaking, I think this should be a reminder to everyone that it doesn’t matter how good you are, you’ll always need to master the basics. If your kid doesn’t want to do their multiplication tables, you could say something like, “you don’t want to be like the Yankees in Game 5 of the 2024 World Series, do you?”

2. [The Legally Blonde book](https://www.amazon.com/Legally-Blonde-Amanda-Brown/dp/0751534552)

Despite the fact that I’ve watched the Legally Blonde movie at least twenty times, I must call myself a fake fan because I didn’t know that the movie was based on a book.

And it wasn’t until I got to Stanford and had lunch with someone in my dorm who told me that her mother had written the Legally Blonde book based on her experience at Stanford Law School that I realized that the original story took place at Stanford!!

I, of course, immediately downloaded the book and read it in one sitting. I honestly loved it – it’s a quick read and it’s clear how the movie replicated the spirit and experiences in the book. Highly recommend it if you're a fan of the movie :)

3. [Essay Writing as Personal Sovereignty](https://cosmosinstitute.substack.com/p/essay-writing-as-personal-sovereignty?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web)

I’ve admired Michael Dean since my very first Write of Passage cohort, where he created incredible graphics to explain abstract writing concepts. Unsurprisingly, this essay of his is one of my favorite takes on artificial intelligence and writing I’ve seen in a while – and I’m in a writing class called “The Rhetoric of Robots and AI.”

My favorite quote is this: “As we enter the age of artificial intelligence, it’s worth being honest about the shortcomings of the Enlightenment, education, and the essay; our existential problem isn’t about chatbots replacing our greatest authors, but that the median citizen will have no meaningful reason to write.” Writing has become such a powerful force in my life – it’s through writing that I’ve gained the opportunities and experiences with the people I have. It’s through writing that I can share and express my thoughts and ideas – and connect with the people who both agree and disagree with me.

If you’re reading this article, I encourage you to be a part of that 1:1 ratio that Michael talks about – write even just 100 words on something you’ve been thinking about. Clarify your thoughts. Connect with others.

You never know what writing could bring you.
