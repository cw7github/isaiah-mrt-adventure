### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: Why I’m spending my summer doing Calculus
2. How (and why) to use my favorite online math app
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

Now that last week’s heartbreak of my friends leaving for college has begun to cool down, the sadness has been replaced with anxiety – I’ve been lying awake at night with my thoughts going a million miles an hour, thinking about the upcoming months.

I’ve been trying to keep myself distracted during the day with a multitude of activities. I’ve loved listening to Post Malone’s new album and performing a full-on choreographed concert in my bathroom after I wake up and before I go to sleep (I’m basically Taylor Swift). I’ve been busy working through Math Academy – I’m now on Calc II and will hopefully finish soon after I arrive in California.

I’ve also, of course, begun the arduous process of packing up my stuff, which really makes the situation feel more real. Terrifying.

### Austin’s Anecdote: Why I’m spending my summer doing Calculus

I’m in the middle of my last few weeks of summer before college and I’ve decided to spend my time doing… math.

About a month ago, my anxiety about college kicked in, and I freaked out about being able to do Stanford-level math courses. So I, of course, turned to my trusted online apps to help out.

I started in Calc I, and in about three weeks I was able to refresh everything I’d forgotten in the two years since I took Calculus. I remembered how to do derivatives and integrals (and I also remembered how much fun it is to work with them). I’ve begun now to work through Calc II and feel kind of empowered by my math skills.

I am continuing to solve hard math problems every day, and I know that I am preparing myself to succeed in college-level math.

Because of how well Math Academy is going so far, I’ve decided that I’m going to continue working through the app in college (probably 30 minutes/day). That way I can always be one course ahead and will thus have the chance to truly learn and master the material.

Y’all know me – always doing my best to set myself up for success.

### How (and why) to use my favorite online math app

Because Math Academy has been so helpful for me, I want to dedicate this newsletter to the topic of using it, so hopefully your kids can find it valuable too.

I’ve split this article into two sections: the background behind Math Academy, and my top recommendations for how to use the app:

1. The Math Academy Way

Math Academy is truly a revolutionary online app. You don’t have to just take my word for it – the developers of Math Academy have written a 350+ page book on the learning science backing their software.

The book begins with Bloom’s two-sigma problem: that “the average tutored student performed better than 98% in a traditional class,” but that it’s impossible for every student to have their own individual human tutor.

As they say in the first chapter: “Math Academy is solving Bloom’s two-sigma problem by… emulat[ing] the decisions of an expert tutor to provide the most effective way to learn math.”

Next, they compare talent development (seen in training for sports, music, etc.) against traditional schooling. Most schools ignore talent development, but Math Academy utilizes the major themes of development (learning tasks, mastery, individualized learning) to help kids become good at math just as they would become good at playing the piano.

My favorite part of Math Academy is that it’s completely based on learning science. Here are the particular ideas used in the app:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eTjQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e6c1c5e-a4a8-4f22-b017-eac781b353e7_1179x561.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eTjQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e6c1c5e-a4a8-4f22-b017-eac781b353e7_1179x561.jpeg)[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aSou!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f116f1c-80b5-4cbd-9aee-17f49d7bcf96_1179x1173.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aSou!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f116f1c-80b5-4cbd-9aee-17f49d7bcf96_1179x1173.jpeg)

Every single aspect of Math Academy has a purpose; every activity furthers the efficiency of your child’s learning. The book continues on with misconceptions about math learning and technical deep-dives on different aspects of the app, but the above ideas are the true core of the piece (and the tool).

2. How to use Math Academy

To get your kid started, all you have to do is pick their grade level and turn on the holistic assessment. This will ensure that your kid is getting lessons from other grade levels that they might not have mastered yet. Finally, set an XP goal. One XP translates to about one minute, so I would recommend setting it to 30 XP after school every day. And you’re all set. Your kid will begin with the assessment and will continue completing their XP each day.

Now, to keep them engaged, utilize Math Academy’s leaderboard feature. There are different leagues (they start in Iron and move up to Sapphire) and every week that they move up a league or maintain Sapphire, they can get a reward (extra screen time, sleepover on a school night, sweet treat, etc.). Doing this should keep your kid motivated.

For a more in-depth discussion on how to use Math Academy, check out their [FAQ page](https://www.mathacademy.com/faq).

Math Academy is possibly the best way for any kid to learn and truly master math. It doesn’t matter where your kid is starting or what they believe their math ability to be, Math Academy can efficiently get your kid up to grade level and beyond.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. Math Academy developers’ posts

The developers of Math Academy are truly experts in learning science and teaching kids math, so their X accounts provide incredible insights and ideas every day. Here were two that stood out for me this week:

[The Math Academy knowledge tree](https://x.com/ninja_maths/status/1825622462681461216) – this post highlights the interconnectedness of math and why mastery is so critical. It’s super hard to move up the tree and work on branches if you don’t have a solid trunk.

[Advice for a standardized math test](https://x.com/justinskycak/status/1825243315245031557) – the best way to prepare for standardized tests (not just math) is to take practice tests in order to pinpoint your weak points. Then, you can use spaced repetition and other learning science methods to master those topics.

2. [Foundation TV Show](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/foundation/umc.cmc.5983fipzqbicvrve6jdfep4x3)

One of my best friends and I have had the same routine every day this past week: we meet up, grab lunch or a sweet treat, go back to my apartment, turn on Foundation, and work on a puzzle while watching. We’ve been on a Sci-Fi journey, having read the *Dune* series and *Foundation* series together, so it’s a fitting use of our time together to watch the show together, too. My favorite parts of the show include the following: Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow (my favorites in the book series. Although they’re pretty different in the show, they have the same spirit), the genetic dynasty (I found this to be SUCH an interesting addition. Huge fan of the tension between the brothers.), Demerzel (very timely discussion on AI and robots – also she’s just super cool), and the religious threads throughout (Day traveling to the Maiden to negotiate with the Luminism leaders, Gaal’s home planet, and the Foundation using the Galactic Spirit to add planets to their own growing empire – such a fascinating commentary on the power of religion in society).

Personally, despite the differences between the book and the show, I found *Foundation* to be an engaging show filled with ideas on what makes society work, the tension between stagnancy and change, the power of knowledge, and diplomatic intricacies. Highly recommend this show if you like Sci-Fi.

3. [The Snowball](https://www.amazon.com/Snowball-Warren-Buffett-Business-Life/dp/0553384619)

I’ve begun reading Warren Buffet’s biography, and my goodness is it fascinating. One of the key themes that stuck out to me was how the biography showcased that you *can* start young – that teenagers are capable of going out and starting a business. I’m not finished yet, but here are some of my favorite quotes:

“Humility disarms.”

“In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it’s a weighing machine.”

“Cornering the market on shoe buttons made him an expert on everything. Warren and I have always sensed it would be a big mistake to behave that way.”

“The best way to begin making money is to begin…”

“Compounding married the present to the future.”

“Class 1 truths were absolutes. Class 2 truths became truths by conviction. If enough people thought a company’s stock was worth X, it became worth X until enough people thought otherwise. Yet that did not affect the stock’s intrinsic value—which was a Class 1 truth.”

Something extra for this week: There’s an online cohort-based course called [How to Write With AI](https://www.writewithai.xyz/) that seems *incredible*. Unfortunately, it begins two days after I move into Stanford, so I don’t think I’ll be able to handle the course on top of starting college. However, if you are able, I highly recommend checking out this course.

As AI continues to get better and better, it will become more important to be able to utilize it in your day-to-day life. Whether you’re writing emails or drafting a memo, using AI will make the task more efficient and productive – and this course looks like it will do a fantastic job at ensuring you become an expert in communication through AI.
