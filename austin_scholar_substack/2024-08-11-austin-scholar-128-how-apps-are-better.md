### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. How apps are better for AP prep than a classroom
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

This last Monday was my dad’s birthday, so I just wanted to take this space to express how truly grateful I am for him and everything he’s done for me. My dad is the most inspiring person I know and his commitment to transforming education to help millions of kids makes me want to work harder on my newsletter every day. His hugs are so warm and watching him banter with my sister never fails to bring a smile to my face. And watching some baseball games with him this last week was incredible – I learned about investing, pitching strategies, and history throughout our conversations during the game. I love you, dad, and hope you had the best birthday ever!!

### How apps are better for AP prep than a classroom

I can’t claim to be a total expert in AP exams (that honor goes to my best friend who took, like, 10 AP courses and got all 5s), but I did alright. I took seven AP exams and got four 5s and three 4s. (And it’s not just the two of us getting high scores – 95% of Alpha students got 4s and 5s on their APs last year, which is pretty cool.)

As you know if you've been around for a while, I haven't had a teacher since the fourth grade. I didn't study for my AP exams in a formal classroom – everything I needed to ace my tests came from the online apps I used to study.

I cared a lot about my APs because I knew I wanted to get into a good college, so I spent a ton of time strategizing about which tests to take and how to prepare for them.

So if your kid is getting ready to start high school or wants to be better prepared for their AP exams this year, here are my recommendations on what AP exams to take and how to study for them:

Freshman year:

* AP Human Geography

This is honestly my number one recommendation for students to take their freshman year. The exam itself isn’t *that* challenging and is a great introduction to writing free response questions. For this course, I would recommend checking out the [Mr. Sinn](https://www.youtube.com/c/mrsinn) YouTube channel and Ultimate Review Packet, along with [TeachTap](https://teachtap.learnwith.ai/). Additionally, making sure you know the [task verbs](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-human-geography/exam-tips) for the FRQs is crucial. For FRQ practice, I would recommend using past exams FRQ questions and asking ChatGPT to grade your responses.

Sophomore – Senior year:

Everyone’s interests and skill sets are different, so there’s no “one clear path” that will work for everyone, *but* if your kid is aiming for a top 20 college, along with a 1500+ SAT score, they should have three 5s on hard AP exams. There’s no set list, but here are some of the widely-accepted “hard APs”:

* AP World History
* AP US History
* AP Language and Composition
* AP Literature and Composition
* AP Biology
* AP Chemistry
* AP Physics 1 & 2
* AP Physics C
* AP Calculus BC

Depending on your kid’s interest, they can mix-and-match at least three of the above courses to get their academic resumé up to par.

To study for these exams, I would recommend using the following:

* [TeachTap](https://teachtap.learnwith.ai/) to learn and practice the material (history + science)
* [Albert](https://www.albert.io/) for challenging practice questions (all APs)
* [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/learn) for AP Calculus BC
* [AP Daily videos](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/instructional-resources/ap-daily) for concepts you’re struggling with (just watching the videos isn’t going to help – you need to then take what you’ve learned and answer practice questions on Albert)
* [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/) to help grade practice FRQs (it can give you personalized instruction based on the rubric and give you specific steps to take to improve your next one)
* [CollegeBoard](https://www.collegeboard.org/) practice tests (this is the best way to practice – make sure to do at least three or four before taking the actual exam)

So many of my friends in traditional schools lament about how their teacher didn’t cover all the material in the AP exam, or how their class didn’t spend enough time on the confusing topics You have the power to take back control over your results – you don’t have to rely on a teacher.

By spending thirty minutes per subject per day, at home, using apps and preparing for the exams, you can pretty much guarantee yourself a score you’ll be proud of.

One other thing to note – when I was first learning how to use these online tools to study for AP exams, it took me a lot of time to learn the material and answer practice questions. But by my senior year, I spent less than 20 minutes per day on AP European History and scored a 5 on the exam. You’ll learn what works for you and how to learn more efficiently.

Parents: you have to support your kid here. Doing this kind of test prep will require them to do work outside of school requirements, so give them a reward. A sweet treat at the end of the week or a nice dinner or manicure or sports game after taking a practice test will help keep them motivated.

Show them you’re noticing the hard work they’re putting in.

And to showcase how utilizing these apps for AP exam prep cuts your studying time down significantly (despite the small amounts of extra work per day), here is some data on how long it takes to master AP content and get a 5:

Normally, students are recommended to spend [1-3 hours](https://sjhexpress.com/opinion/2024/01/26/ap-classes-the-time-to-choose-is-now/) on homework and studying per day, *per AP*, along with the hour per day of class time. That means students spend up to 740 hours on AP work per year – and that’s if they’re only taking one AP. To be honest, that workload seems extremely unmanageable.

However, if they use online apps instead, they can spend, on average, thirty minutes studying per day and will be able to complete their homework faster because the apps ensure they *actually* learn the material.

Here’s a breakdown by AP (this is data and research from Alpha!):

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DS-f!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3c11375-ae3d-47a9-ae49-c0d923391fc3_952x470.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DS-f!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3c11375-ae3d-47a9-ae49-c0d923391fc3_952x470.png)

As you can see, students are spending *way* more time than is necessary studying for AP exams. If you can get them to take a leap and try out a different way of learning, they’ll be cutting down their study time by hundreds of hours.

Pretty cool, right?

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [The Math Academy Way](https://www.justinmath.com/files/the-math-academy-way.pdf)

I’ve started to use this new app to prepare for college-level Calculus, and it’s been absolutely incredible. I’m 90% completed with my refresher of Calculus I and will move right ahead to Calculus II in order to (hopefully) get completely caught up before I even step foot in the classroom. I’ll have enough to worry about even without learning Calculus all over again. Since I’m using this app, I thought I’d read their 350-page mission and explanation of their app and the learning science behind it. My biggest takeaway: these guys are true experts in how people learn. Here are some of the highlights:

*Active learning produces more learning by increasing cognitive activation, but students often mistakenly interpret extra cognitive effort (such as productive struggle and occasional confusion) as an indication that they are not learning as well, when in fact the opposite is true.* [On why traditional school practices don’t implement effective learning science strategies.]

*In other words, maximal learning does not happen naturally as a result of maximizing other things like enjoyment, comfort, convenience, and ease of practice. In fact, maximal learning is at odds with some of these things. Sacrifices must be made.* [On why many classrooms don’t prioritize maximal learning – it is not as enjoyable.]

*A student who got an ‘A’ in Algebra I was predicted to be in the 73rd percentile of the test distribution in 2015-16, the 68th percentile in 2018-19, and the 58th percentile in 2021-22.* [On the declining standards in the classroom.]

*Once a student has accumulated a critical number of gaps…then the student is doomed to struggle unless proper remediation is enacted to fill in those gaps.* [On why students stop succeeding in or enjoying math – they gain too many foundational gaps to understand what’s going on.]

There’s *a lot* of good stuff in the book about learning science, so I’ll be writing an article on Math Academy and its techniques after I finish getting through Calculus.

2. [Deadpool and Wolverine](https://www.marvel.com/movies/deadpool-and-wolverine)

Given that this is a Rated-R movie and EXTREMELY gory, this is another movie that I can’t exactly recommend that you watch with your kid, but there are some super interesting points about storytelling that I wanted to talk about. Deadpool and Wolverine is the epitome of what a superhero movie should be – it follows the hero’s journey almost perfectly. The “ordinary world” being Deadpool’s retirement, “call to adventure” being the TVA telling him that his world needs a Wolverine to survive, “entering the unknown” being the void, “allies and mentors” being all of the nostalgic heroes (Nicepool, Johnny Storm, Elektra, Blade, Gambit, etc.).

To be quite honest, there’s nothing revolutionary about the plot – it’s a fun movie with a *ton* of hilarious jokes and cameos, but they didn’t overcomplicate it. And that’s why it’s so successful. When you have good characters and an inspiring storyline, you don’t need to introduce more time travel or crazy superpowers to have a good story. Go back to the basics.

3. [Jackson Premiere Fusion Skates](https://jacksonultima.com/products/premiere-fusion-2800)

This is honestly more of a skating update than a source, but I’ve gotten new skates!! I finally traded in my four-years-old, broken down skates for shiny, new, axel-ready Premieres. I’ve skated every day this week and my feet are absolutely killing me, but I feel so much more stable in my jumps and have been able to tighten up my spins now that I don’t have to spend as much energy keeping my foot stable. I’ve realized that I’ve been holding myself back by continuing to wear my old skates – I’ve been learning bad habits to compensate for my worn out equipment. For me, this has been a good lesson that it doesn’t matter how hard I work, if I don’t have the right tools, I can’t continue building my skill set.
