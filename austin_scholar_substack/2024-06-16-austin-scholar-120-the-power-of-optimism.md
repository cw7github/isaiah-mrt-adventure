### Austin’s Anecdote: The power of optimism

The world makes it very easy to be negative.

*I hate this. Everything sucks. The system is a failure. Everyone hates me. Nothing will work. I can’t do it. This project is going to fail.*

Couple these types of negative thoughts with my poor mental health from a few years ago and you’ve got the perfect recipe for an unhappy person.

For years, I could look at anything around me and find something terrible. I could nitpick all of the flaws in any idea – to the point that it was really easy to find things wrong even with the idea that I should be happy,.

I had this ugly, gray film distorting my vision, making the world seem like a dismal place.

I could complain to myself for hours about this ugly gray world, and get lost in sadness.

What a terrible way to live.

And, unfortunately, I have to say, this mindset isn’t uncommon among teenagers. It’s *cool* to be jaded and upset and yell about everything wrong with the system. Social media is filled with complaints and laments – and very rarely are solutions offered.

I believe this is a huge part of the teen mental health epidemic – the constant messages we’re receiving about the doomed world we live in and the judgment we get about liking anything from makeup to celebrities to sports to TV shows.

So if we want to fix it, we have to change our mindset.

One of the most important things I started doing in the last few years was to practice gratitude.

Every morning, I wr0te down three things I was grateful for that happened the day before. I started my day thinking only of the good in the world, and I did my best to remind myself of those things during the day.

I also started to reframe my thoughts from negative to positive.

Instead of saying “I don’t want to go to school because I hate this physics exam,” I would tell myself “I’m lucky to be at the school I am.”

I started to smile more – just for fun. If I sat in my room reading or scrolling, I’d take a few moments to just look up and smile. It’s hard to think bad thoughts when you’re smiling.

My life became so much better.

I saw the good in every little thing and complained *far* less. I became so much more enjoyable to be around and just became a happier person.

Creating an optimistic outlook on the world for myself is one of the best things I’ve ever done.

### How to help your kid become more optimistic

It can be really hard to get an angsty teenager to change their mind about the world, but here are a few tips to make it a little easier:

1. Practice noticing the negativity

This is absolutely step one in changing your mindset – you first have to notice that the one you have is negative (or is at least occasionally negative).

Point out whenever your kid says something like “we can’t do that” or “X is going to be terrible” and tell them to do the same for you. (Often, your kid will be willing to do something hard if you’re doing it as well – and they might enjoy getting to call you out a little.) You can even come up with a code word to throw out there for a pessimistic thought if you don’t want to disrupt conversation.

Also, by drawing attention to the negativity, your kid will start to realize that negative thoughts are bad, even if you haven’t done anything except point out that they exist.

2. Practice neutralizing the negativity

One of my favorite parts of DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) is the practice of neutralizing thoughts. You don’t have to go straight from negative to positive, just negative to neutral. This makes the thoughts easier to believe and accept.

For example, instead of “we can’t do that,” say “we will definitely try our best.”

Or instead of “X is going to be terrible,” say “I’m not sure how this is going to go.”

Neutral is better than negative, yet easier than positive.

3. Send them articles or books about optimism

There’s nothing that makes you want to change your mindset more than being told [you’ll live longer if you’re optimistic](https://www.science.org/content/article/cheer-optimists-live-longer#:~:text=Here's%20a%20good%20reason%20to,of%20people%20and%203%20decades.) or that [optimism makes you more likely to be successful and satisfied](https://www.psychologs.com/why-is-optimism-important-to-achieve-success/)…

…Just as long as it’s not your parents saying it (and as long as there’s data to back it up).

Instead of aggressively pushing optimism on your kids, just send them some helpful articles like [this one](https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/optimism.html#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20spent%20a%20lot,are%20at%20risk%20for%20it.) and the ones previously linked. You don’t even have to say anything – (hopefully) they’ll eventually pick it up.

4. You have to display a positive outlook

Kids imitate their parents. If you’re going around being negative and pessimistic about things, your kids will learn to be too.

And on the flip side, if you change your habits and mindset, they’ll be more likely to follow.

Set your kid up for success. Be optimistic.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [Survivor Season 13: Cook Islands](https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Survivor:_Cook_Islands)

If you want to learn about resilience and grit, watch this season of Survivor. About halfway through this season, Jeff Probst (the host) offers every player on both tribes the opportunity to ‘mutiny’ (go to the other tribe). Two people decide to switch from tribe A to tribe B, so the numbers then stand at tribe A with four people and tribe B with eight.

If you know anything about Survivor, you know that’s not a good thing. Survivor is a numbers and relationships game, so if you don’t have the numbers, you’re pretty likely to get voted out.

But, instead of giving up, the tribe A four get back up and proceed to win every challenge, find the immunity idol, and convince someone from the other tribe to be in their alliance. The four of them get every single player from the other tribe voted out and become the final four.

Absolutely incredible.

2. [Ana Lorena Fabrega’s post](https://x.com/anafabrega11/status/1795496853779239314)

If you’ve ever wanted an inside look at Alpha, check out Ana Lorena Fabrega’s post about the school. She provides video interviews and lots of footage of workshops and the kids. Super cute and definitely worth a watch.

3. [A Curse for True Love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62816044-a-curse-for-true-love)

This is the final book in the series I’d been reading with my friends, and the conversations didn’t disappoint. The ending was terribly confusing and pretty much none of the magical backstory was explained, so there were a *lot* of question marks and screenshots of book pages sent over text. But I do have to admit – overall, the story was very cute and fun to read, as long as you don’t take it too seriously. I had so much fun reading it with my friends and *highly* recommend your kid do something similar if they don’t love to read. Doing something with your friends can help you find the value and fun in any situation.
