### **Hey, y’all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. How to act like an Amazonian
2. Scholar’s Sources: My summer reading list

And… studying for midterms has begun! For those of y’all who subscribed over the summer (thank you and I’m super grateful for you!), you haven’t yet seen that after week three at Stanford, I pretty much never stop studying for midterms. Because of the quarter system, my academic schedule is condensed – so while I don’t have many quizzes, I pretty much have a midterm to study for at all times. I’ve upgraded my ChatGPT study prompts for this year, so I’ll let y’all know how that goes!

### How to act like an Amazonian

One of the books I read this summer was [Working Backwards](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=working+backwards&hvadid=583831399339&hvdev=c&hvexpln=0&hvlocphy=9031970&hvnetw=g&hvocijid=738465643569871344--&hvqmt=e&hvrand=738465643569871344&hvtargid=kwd-313376453726&hydadcr=9004_13539762&mcid=c807cecf5707365d8efa934683bd9bec&tag=googhydr-20&ref=pd_sl_1dpxcuf1u1_e) by Bill Car and Colin Bryar and I have to say that it completely changed how I think about achievement.

Everyone knows Amazon is ridiculously successful. But I loved reading about how Amazon’s empire was built by creating an intentional culture through specific, repeatable exercises that anyone can replicate. Including your kid.

Before we dive into the exercises, let’s talk about why culture matters more than you think. Amazon didn’t become a trillion-dollar company because of superior technology or first-mover advantage (remember, Barnes & Noble was already selling books online). They won because they built a culture that could adapt, innovate, and execute consistently at scale.

Culture might feel like some fluffy corporate buzzword. But it’s not. It’s the collection of daily practices, decision-making frameworks, and shared mental models that determine how a group operates. And here’s why this matters to you: the same principles that build strong organizational cultures can build strong family cultures and individual thinking patterns.

When you implement cultural exercises at home, you’re not just teaching skills – you’re installing operating systems. You’re giving your kid frameworks that will guide their decisions long after they’ve left your house. That’s infinitely more valuable than any specific piece of knowledge or achievement.

Let me break down what Amazon actually does before we transform these into kid-friendly exercises:

**1. Working backwards (PR/FAQ)**

Amazon doesn’t build products and then figure out who might want them. They start by writing a press release along with an FAQ announcing the product as if it already exists, focusing entirely on customer benefits. Then they work backwards to figure out what needs to be built to make that press release true. This forces them to clarify the value proposition before investing any resources.

**2. The 6-pager**

Amazon banned PowerPoint. Instead, they write six-page narratives for any major decision or proposal. These documents require complete sentences, logical flow, and comprehensive thinking. Meetings start with everyone silently reading the document for 20 minutes, then discussing. This ensures everyone’s actually prepared and thinking deeply, not just reacting to bullet points.

**3. Single-Threaded Leadership**

Major initiatives are owned completely by a single leader. No committees, no shared accountability, no “dotted-line reporting.” One person, one mission, total ownership. This creates clarity, speed, and genuine accountability.

Now here’s where it gets interesting. These aren’t just business principles. They’re also thinking tools, and they have the power to transform how your kid approaches everything from homework to hobbies to life goals.

**Exercise 1:** Working backwards

Instead of writing fake press releases (probably too boring), have your kid create “time capsules from the future.” For any goal or project, have them create artifacts from their future successful self:

* A journal entry from one year in the future describing what they accomplished
* A text conversation with a friend celebrating their success
* A social media post showing off their achievement
* A thank-you note from someone who benefited from their work
* A newspaper headline about their accomplishment
* An award acceptance speech (bonus points for recording it!)
* A before/after photo comparison showing their transformation

Then, have them work backwards from these artifacts to create a monthly action plan. What would they need to do each month to make these future artifacts real?

Then, create a “Future Museum” wall in their room where they display these artifacts. Use aged paper (coffee staining works great), create fake Instagram posts printed on cardstock, write the newspaper headline in actual newsprint font. The more real it feels, the more powerful the mental shift.

Once they’ve created their future artifacts, play “detective.” Put all the artifacts on a table and work backwards like a crime scene investigator. What clues in the thank-you note hint at skills they need to develop? What does the social media post reveal about the connections they have to make? Create a giant timeline on butcher paper, starting from the future success and marking every milestone that had to happen in reverse order.

When kids visualize specific, concrete success (not vague “I want to do well”), they naturally identify the steps needed to get there. The shift transforms abstract goals into tangible targets. Imagine your kid writing a future text to a friend: “Dude, I just got into Stanford! The essay about my coding project for helping elderly people learn smartphones totally sealed it.” Now they know they need to: learn coding, identify a community need, build something meaningful, and document the impact.

**Exercise 2:** 6-pager

Once a month, anyone in the family can pitch an idea – from vacation destinations to new house rules to personal projects. In order to propose the idea, they must write a one-page (the exercise is called a six-pager but for something like this one page will do) proposal that includes:

* The problem they’re solving
* Their proposed solution
* Why current approaches don’t work
* How we’ll know if it’s successful
* What could go wrong and how they’ll handle it
* A catchy title for their proposal (creativity counts!)
* One visual element (graph, drawing, diagram) that makes their point

The family reads it together (silently, with snacks – make it an event), then discusses and votes. Winners get family resources (time, money, support) to execute their idea.

Create official “Proposal Day” traditions. Use a timer for the silent reading period. Give everyone colored pens to annotate as they read. Have a special gavel for calling the meeting to order. Create voting cards with scores from 1-10. The proposer gets a “founder’s chair” to sit in during discussion. Make it feel important because it is.

It’s also important to have parents propose something to the kids using the same format. Want a new family rule about screen time? Better write a compelling one-pager that addresses their concerns and objections. By making this the format for new ideas and rules, you’re cementing the idea that this is a part of your family culture and challenging your kid to really think through the things they’re asking for..

This exercise builds the ability to hold complex ideas in mind and develop them fully. When your kid has to write out why the family should adopt a dog instead of just begging repeatedly, they learn to construct actual arguments. They learn to anticipate objections. They learn that good ideas require good thinking, not just enthusiasm.

**Exercise 3:** Single-Threaded Leadership

Each family member gets to be “CEO” of one project per year where they have complete ownership. They pick the project, set the timeline, manage any budget, recruit help, and own the outcome completely. No parental swooping in to save the day, no shared responsibility.

Projects could be:

* Planning and executing a party for all of their friends
* Organizing a neighborhood event
* Managing a family garden to grow their favorite flower or vegetable
* Building something for the house (treehouse, reading nook, game room reorganization)
* Running a week of family dinners with planned menus, shopping, and cooking
* Creating and maintaining a family YouTube channel or blog for 3 months

To get them started, give them actual tools of leadership. A special notebook for their CEO notes. Access to a budgeting app or spreadsheet. Business cards with “[Project Name] CEO” on them. A weekly time slot for their “board meeting” with the family. Let them create a project logo.

Create a standard format: progress update (with metrics!), problems faced, help needed, wins to celebrate, and pivots being considered. The family can offer advice but can’t take over. End each report with the CEO ringing a bell if they hit their weekly goal.

When your kid is genuinely responsible for the neighborhood function and it goes wrong because they didn’t ask for RSVPs and didn’t get enough lemonade, they learn about due diligence in a way no lecture could teach. At the same time, they’ll learn how much can be done and how completely they can make their own dreams reality when they have full control.

Here’s the thing about culture change: it’s not about doing everything at once. Pick one exercise and commit to it for 30 days. Make it non-negotiable. Make it fun. Make it yours.

Start with whichever exercise addresses your family’s biggest current challenge:

* Lack of motivation? Working backwards
* Poor communication? 6-pager
* No follow-through? Single-threaded leadership

The magic isn’t in the individual exercises; rather, it’s in the compound effect of practicing them consistently. Just like Amazon didn’t become Amazon overnight, your family culture won’t transform immediately. But each rep builds muscle.

At the core, these exercises aren’t really about achievement at all. They’re about building young humans who think clearly, act deliberately, and create value for others. They’re about replacing the chaos of adolescence with frameworks for decision-making.

When your kid learns to write narratives instead of screaming in anger, to own projects completely instead of doing the minimum, and to work backwards, you’re creating a human who understands how to create value in the world.

And unlike traditional education that promises vague “critical thinking” skills, these are concrete, practical, immediately applicable frameworks. Your kid won’t have to wait until they’re 22 to use these skills. They can start literally today.

All of this tends toward the goal of strengthening your family’s culture and teaching your kid how to move forward in the world confident in their own values and skills.
