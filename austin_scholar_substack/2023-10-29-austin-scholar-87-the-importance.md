### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: The importance of asking good questions
2. A high schooler's guide to asking good questions
3. Scholar’s Sources: Interesting things I’ve read this week

Big news: I’ve applied to college!!

I submitted my application to UK schools last week, and just yesterday I sent in my Stanford application. I am, of course, still working on my regular decision applications, but this last week has relieved so much stress.

I’m excited to keep you updated on how everything goes.

### Austin’s Anecdote: The importance of asking good questions

Asking good questions is one of the most important skills you can teach your high schooler. But most high schoolers aren't very good at it. Let me give you an example.

Earlier this week, the Alpha High guides presented us with some changes that are being made at school. (It's a startup school, so changes are a common occurrence.) It was a twenty-minute presentation, but it dragged on for an hour.

Why? The students kept asking questions.

And not super smart questions.

Questions that had been answered already. Questions about scenarios that were obscure edge cases and would never actually happen. Questions that literally had their answer on the slide right in front of us.

And so, we all wasted an hour of our time listening to repetitive information and ridiculous situations.

This entire scenario gave me deja-vu of a similar day a few years ago that completely changed my perspective on asking questions.

When I was in eighth grade–before the COVID lockdown–the head of school at the time sat down with all of the students to explain the changes that were going to be put in place that year.

He talked about the requirements to get into high school, and new expectations for using the apps. You know, the really important stuff. And then he made a grievous error. He mentioned that next session, Alpha might implement a house system – just like Harry Potter.

And my goodness, did that open the floodgates. Every single hand went up.

*A house system? Like Harry Potter? How many houses would there be? Would there be house captains? How would houses be chosen? What would they be called? Wait, the house system is like Harry Potter?*

There were a seemingly infinite number of questions about trivial, completely irrelevant things. But our young brains were stuck on the idea we found most interesting in the discussion: the houses.

A few parents also listened in to this talk, and let me tell you: they were not impressed with our thinking abilities.

Every adult walked away from that discussion wondering if these kids were actually intelligent. How can online apps teach kids reading comprehension and critical thinking skills if they can’t comprehend the (very clear) main idea of a presentation?

Honestly, that’s when it clicked for me – you can tell a lot about a person based on the questions they ask. And we make snap judgments based on the competence level of someone’s questions.

Questions are so much more important than I had ever thought they were, but basically no kid learns how to ask them.

So, here’s my guide for how to ask good questions (that will make you seem impressive):

### A high schooler's guide to asking good questions

There are two levels to question asking: one, making sure you aren't asking "stupid" questions; and two, learning how to ask really good ones.

We'll talk about avoiding asking unhelpful questions first.

There are a few immediate checks kids can make to ensure their questions should be asked in a group setting:

1. Does this question only apply to me?
2. Is this scenario extremely unlikely to occur?
3. Has this question been answered already and I just don’t remember what the answer was?
4. Is it probable my question will be answered before the end of the discussion?

If any of these are answered with a “yes”, you should probably find a different time to ask your question. For example:

1. Ask the instructor or speaker in a one-on-one setting.
2. Only ask the question if it becomes more likely or relevant.
3. Try asking one of your peers or wait to see if they remember the answer, or simply wait until after to ask your question one-on-one.
4. Wait to ask your question until the end.

If you follow these rules, you’ll most likely be able to escape asking a “stupid” question. But what if you want to ask a *good* question? Well, let’s start by defining what a good question is, beyond just one that makes you sound impressive.

Here are three defining characteristics of a good question:

1. Purposeful

This goes back to ensuring that every audience member – and maybe even the speaker – gains something from both the question and the answer. Steer away from asking questions intended to make people angry and questions that most of the audience will not gain anything from sitting through. The audience will gain something from your question if it is one that they didn’t think themselves to ask, or that they need to know the answer to in order to accomplish or complete something. The speaker, on the other hand, can learn what parts of their speech were weak or confusing.

2. Specific and concise

Make sure your question is extremely clear and easy to understand so that you’ll get the answer you’re looking for.

3. Thoughtful

Don’t ask questions that you can Google the answer to. Ask a question that will make the speaker think about their answer. *That* is the sign of a good question.

Here's how to put all of this together to ask a good question:

1. Identify your purpose

What will the audience and speaker gain from this question?

2. Go through the checklist

Ensure that you’re not asking a “stupid” question.

3. Make it specific

Provide a clear direction and explanation for the speaker and audience.

4. Make sure you’re actively listening

Pay attention to the answers you receive and respond appropriately. This not only shows respect to the person you're conversing with, but it can also help you formulate better follow-up questions if needed.

5. If applicable for the situation (ex. getting to know someone or interviewing someone), make the question open-ended

Formulate your questions to be open-ended rather than yes/no questions. This encourages more thoughtful, comprehensive responses.

Finally, here are two question equations to use to construct a great question, as well as a ChatGPT prompt to use.

For clarification (use this equation when your understanding of a situation has changed throughout the speech):

`good clarifying question = "I initially understood..."+ "but it now sounds like..."+ "could you provide more context?" - information already said`

For elaboration (use this equation when you want to learn more about something):

`good elaboration question = "I understand the big picture of..." +"but could you provide a specific example scenario?"`

The ChatGPT prompt: *[Explain scenario]. What are good, challenging questions I should ask during the presentation/talk/speech/interview/socratic discussion?*

Here’s an example: *My school is doing a talk on new expectations for academics. What are good, challenging questions I should ask during the presentation?*

The answer:

1. ***Understanding the Rationale**: "Could you provide more insight into the factors that led to these new academic expectations being established?"*
2. ***Impact on Students**: "How do these new expectations aim to enhance the learning experience for students? And conversely, have there been considerations for potential stress or pressure these changes might add?"*
3. ***Long-Term Goals**: "What are the long-term goals or outcomes that the school hopes to achieve with these new expectations?"*
4. ***Evaluation and Feedback**: "How will the implementation of these new expectations be evaluated? How will student feedback be incorporated into this evaluation?"*

Definitely a step up from “The house system like Harry Potter, right?”

### Scholar’s Sources: Interesting things I’ve read this week

I actually spent two days asking people questions, interview-style, on my Twitter Space. If you want to check out my discussions on the future of education, here are the links for both days ([Day 1](https://x.com/AustinScholar/status/1717548808521822213?s=20). [Day 2](https://x.com/AustinScholar/status/1717896486694895675?s=20).)

I absolutely loved this article by the Harvard Business Review on [The Surprising Power of Questions](https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-surprising-power-of-questions). Here is a great visual to show the different tactics to use to ask and answer questions in different conversations:

As I’m finalizing my college applications, I’ve been reading a *ton* about the admissions process and what colleges are looking for. [Kicking Apps and Making Names](https://www.amazon.com/Kicking-Apps-Making-Names-Successfully/dp/0692999647) is one of my favorite resources and is complete with to-do lists at the end of every chapter.

I absolutely loved this [long-form tweet](https://x.com/tmitrosilis/status/1716443785326915660?s=57&t=8_mwT6_AF5tOVsj-WQV_zw). It combines baseball, fame, and motivation in a fascinating way.

[This](https://x.com/thejacobturner/status/1714997638494335195?s=42&t=--Wxh1KU1EIrDEZl0LAbGA) is another interesting baseball-themed tweet about continuing to have drive and passion, even after you’ve started to see success.

Finally, [this](https://theathletic.com/live-blogs/rangers-vs-astros-live-score-alcs-updates-result/43xQZiLzJo67/) was a fun read after the final Astros-Rangers playoff game, as it dove into the major plays and predictions for the game.
