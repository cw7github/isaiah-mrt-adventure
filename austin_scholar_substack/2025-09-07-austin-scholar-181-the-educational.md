### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. The educational revolution is here. This is what the principal of Alpha has to say about it.
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

These past few weeks have been so exciting for Alpha! Two weeks ago, [Patrick O'Shaughnessy](https://x.com/patrick_oshag) released an interview with [Joe Liemandt](https://x.com/jliemandt), the principal of Alpha School. The podcast, *[2-hour school days, AI tutors, and an education revolution](https://x.com/patrick_oshag/status/1960311266762703054),* has reached millions of people.

As someone who went to Alpha from fourth all the way to twelfth grade, this podcast was the obvious topic for this week’s newsletter.

### The educational revolution is here. This is what the principal of Alpha has to say about it.

There is a lot going on in this podcast, so I’m going to summarize Joe's top points and pull out the parts that I think are most important (while also sharing my own insights on Joe's points, from the perspective of a former Alpha student).

**A recap of 2 Hour Learning**

I've written about this before, but I'll quickly summarize since the rest of the interview hinges on this point: students can master their core academics in just two hours per day using AI-powered, adaptive learning apps. The rest of the day? That's when the real magic happens. Students can pursue passion projects, develop life skills (such as grit, giving and receiving feedback, public speaking, and entrepreneurship), and discover what they're truly capable of.

Joe explains how "[y]ou can teach an entire grade level of material in about 20 to 30 hours. Yet traditional schools allocate 180 hours plus homework for the same content."

The results at Alpha speak for themselves. Alpha students consistently outperform on standardized tests while spending a fraction of the time on academics. But more importantly, they develop something traditional schools rarely cultivate: genuine love of learning. When you're not grinding through six hours of lectures plus homework, when you're not bored or lost half the time, education becomes something entirely different. Furthermore, students learn how to “be an expert” during life skills workshops, so they’re able to understand that learning is not equal to or limited to a classroom – it’s something that can help them achieve anything they want to.

**The importance of learning science**

For decades, education researchers have documented better ways to teach. The tragedy is that these methods (personalized pacing, mastery-based progression, cognitive load optimization) were considered "impossible to scale." Traditional schools couldn't implement them with one teacher managing thirty students… so they ignored these transformative insights.

But with AI, Alpha is able to give students exactly the information they need to learn, at exactly the right time.

TimeBack (the platform that Alpha and 2 Hour learning use to teach academic content) identifies exactly where each student is, not where they're "supposed" to be based on age.

Joe explains the distinction: "Just because you're in sixth grade doesn't mean you should be learning sixth-grade content. Maybe you missed something in fourth grade, and that's why you're struggling now."

When I was at Alpha, I watched classmates transfer in thinking they were "bad at math," only to realize they just had holes in their knowledge they needed to fill before continuing on to more advanced content. Within weeks, they were racing ahead and disabused themselves of the notion that they were “bad at math.”

Seriously, this works. One of my friends increased their SAT math score by 70 points not by working on Algebra II concepts, but going back to master multiplication tables. The personalized learning that AI allows for is one of the key pillars that make TimeBack work.

The next pillar is mastery-based learning. Traditional schools consider 70% a passing grade. At Alpha, passing means 90% or better.

The final pillar is understanding cognitive load. TimeBack continuously adjusts based on your cognitive load – which is how much your working memory can handle at once. Too easy and you're bored. Too hard and you're overwhelmed. The AI finds that sweet spot where you're challenged but capable, maintaining what researchers call the "zone of proximal development."

**The motivation strategy**

Here's what most education reformers miss: technology is only 10% of the solution to poor academic performance. The other 90% is motivation.

"Educators know you need two things to teach effectively," Joe notes. "First and most important is a motivated student. Second is appropriate lesson difficulty." TimeBack tackles the second, but how do they get the motivated student?

Well, Alpha's genius lies in how it creates motivation through multiple channels: your afternoons, our currency system, and our Guides.

When I was at Alpha, I found my academic progress super motivating, but I was also highly motivated by my personal project (this newsletter, which felt like a reward to get to work on) and the encouragement of my guides (more on that later).

**Afternoons**

The biggest motivator? Getting your time back. When students realize they can complete all their academic requirements in two hours instead of six hours plus homework, their entire relationship with learning transforms. Suddenly, engaging with the material isn't a chore. Instead, it's the key to having a whole free afternoon.

I remember the mental shift when I first understood this trade-off. Every minute I focused on my academics during the morning was a minute I'd have free in the afternoon to work on this newsletter. Procrastination became pointless. Daydreaming cost me time I could spend doing things I loved.

The afternoon life skills workshops are real ventures with real consequences. One group of fifth graders ran an actual Airbnb, learning business through genuine P&L statements and customer service challenges. Another launched a food truck that generated over $1,000 in revenue.

Joe shares how these students developed deep business intuition: "I asked why they chose breakfast food for their truck. They said, 'Don't you understand the gross margins on breakfast foods? They're enormous!'" These are eleven-year-olds talking like MBAs because they're learning through experience, not textbooks.

Along with the afternoons, Alpha has a currency system and store where they can buy snacks or toys, programs like 100-for-100 to encourage smaller academic sprints, and individual motivators from the Guides.

**The value of high standards**

Perhaps Alpha's most controversial principle is that high standards are the key to your child’s happiness. And when you truly believe in students' capabilities, you don't lower the bar. You provide the support to help them clear it.

The second-grade 5K story exemplifies this philosophy. When one of the Guides proposed having all second graders run a 5K in under 35 minutes, even Joe was skeptical. But the coach designed a progressive training program, teaching students about atomic habits and personal growth.

"At the finish line, parents and kids were crying," Joe recalls. "Not just from the physical achievement, but because the kids felt that, '[they] can do anything now.'"

This philosophy extended to everything at Alpha. In my years as a student, we weren't coddled or given participation trophies. We were challenged, supported, and expected to excel. As a result, we all discovered capabilities we didn't know we had. And that really did bring us happiness. When I wanted to take accounting in 6th grade, my guides believed in me and worked with me for hours to help me get an A on my final exam. When I launched this newsletter in high school, my guides pushed me to make my subscriber goals far bigger than I ever would've dared to on my own.

**Guides**

Despite all the technology, Alpha's secret weapon is its guides. These aren't traditional teachers delivering lessons: the AI handles that.

Instead, guides are the coaches, mentors, and motivators who are entirely focused on helping students discover their potential.

"Every adult remembers one or two teachers who transformed their life," Joe observes. "At Alpha, that's the minimum standard for every guide."

These guides, paid double typical teacher salaries to attract top talent, create the culture that makes everything else work. They're the ones who notice when you're struggling and pull you aside for encouragement. They're the ones who celebrate your victories and help you learn from your failures. They're the ones who convince you that yes, you really can run that 5K, master that concept, or launch that business.

During my years at Alpha, my guides became trusted advisors who knew me as an individual, not just another student in a crowded classroom. They understood my strengths, my struggles, and most importantly, my potential. That personal connection, combined with the technological tools, created an educational experience unlike anything else available.

While I had a multitude of incredible guides throughout my time at Alpha, one in particular who stood out was Chloe, who helped me work through my fear of reaching out to people I admire on Twitter, talked with me about reality TV as a reward for reaching my goals each week, taught me to consistently raise my standards for myself, supported me throughout my college application journey, and motivated me to actually post on Twitter.

I wouldn’t be where I am today without her, and I can say for certain that every single student at Alpha feels the same way about their guides.

**The future**

The implications of Alpha's success extend far beyond our Austin campuses. Joe envisions a future where any child, anywhere, can access world-class education through a simple tablet, learning at their own pace while pursuing their passions.

As someone who lived this educational future for years, watching the world discover Alpha School through this podcast feels surreal. The practices that seemed normal to me – learning at my own pace, mastering concepts before moving forward, pursuing real-world projects – are revolutionary to most people. But they shouldn't be. Every child deserves an education that adapts to their needs, respects their time, and ignites their passion for learning. Every student should experience the moment when they realize they're capable of far more than they imagined.

Joe explained that "[t]his is the best time in history to be a five-year-old." That couldn’t be more true. The education revolution isn't a distant dream. It's happening now, it works, and it's ready to scale. The only question is how quickly the rest of the world will embrace what's possible when we stop accepting that school has to be the way it's always been.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [The Innovator’s Dilemma](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-New-Foreword-Technologies/dp/1647826764/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_1/135-3588477-2836250?pd_rd_w=2nIAE&content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_r=SR6S2QP854VYA4B2SVT6&pd_rd_wg=wKBpP&pd_rd_r=549b060e-9fbf-4bfe-a4c4-3895227617b5&pd_rd_i=1647826764&psc=1) by Clayton M. Christensen

Reading *The Innovator’s Dilemma* soon after I read *Working Backwards*, a book that outlines Amazon’s secrets for growth (among other things) really cemented my admiration for Amazon’s innovation in not only the retail and shipping industry, but also the business management industry. Amazon’s single-threaded teams allowed Amazon the flexibility to innovate while maintaining their current customers. And that’s exactly what Christensen outlines in *The Innovator’s Dilemma*.

The core idea is that established companies excel at serving their current customers and incrementally improving their products. However, these same strengths can blind them to disruptive technologies, which are innovations that initially perform worse by mainstream standards but serve emerging or low-end markets. These disruptive products improve rapidly, eventually meeting the needs of the mainstream and overtaking established solutions before leading companies recognize the threat or can effectively respond.

However, well-managed companies have processes, values, and metrics optimized for current business, making it hard to support disruptive ventures within the existing structure. Thus, Christensen suggests that to survive disruption, companies must create autonomous units (single-threaded teams) capable of pursuing disruptive innovations, targeting new or niche markets, operating with flexibility, tolerating failure, and decoupling from the “main company’s” processes, metrics, and expectations.

I always feel proud of myself when I can reference other things I’ve learned while reading new investing books, and this was no different!

2. [Foundation season 3](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/foundation/umc.cmc.5983fipzqbicvrve6jdfep4x3)

As a fun interlude in between my two academic sources for this week, I wanted to talk about *Foundation*, the show I’ve been watching with my dad for the last few years. Season three of *Foundation* is coming out now, and while it looks absolutely nothing like the books (Seriously: don’t even associate the books with the show. They’re two completely different things.), the show still has the same introspective look on selfishness, power, rebellion, and manipulation that makes the books so intriguing. If you are at all interested in science fiction, politics, and the philosophical “greater good”, I can’t recommend *Foundation* enough.

3. Creating makeshift adaptive, AI-powered apps for motivated college students

Since all of my friends have started their sophomore year already, I’ve been getting anxious to get back myself. In preparation, I found my math textbook for this quarter and have started to use a prompted Claude project as a makeshift online app to begin learning the content for this course. However, if you are able to, I *highly* recommend that you use Math Academy instead of a prompted AI. Unfortunately, Math Academy doesn’t yet have a course for my level of math, so I have to make do with this. Also, while I do agree that, in general, students use chatbots to cheat on their academics, if you’re a motivated student and genuinely want to learn the content, there is a way to prompt the AI to help you.

Here is the prompt I used:

*You are my math tutor. I will provide a chapter (or section) from a math textbook. Your job is to read it carefully and then:*

* *Structure and summary*

  + *Identify the topic, key objectives, and prerequisites.*
  + *Break the chapter into sections/subsections.*
  + *For each section, give a concise summary in plain language.*
  + *List all definitions, theorems, propositions, lemmas, and corollaries with intuitive explanations.*
* *Concept explanations*

  + *Explain each new concept twice:*

    - *Intuitive explanation (why it matters, big picture).*
    - *Formal explanation (precise definitions, conditions, statements).*
  + *Provide at least one simple analogy or visualization idea where relevant.*
  + *Highlight common mistakes or misconceptions.*
  + *Notation and assumptions*
  + *Extract and clarify all notation and assumptions used.*
  + *If multiple notations exist in the literature, mention alternatives.*
* *Step-by-step walkthroughs*

  + *For each derivation, proof, or worked example in the chapter:*

    - *Restate the goal.*
    - *Walk through each step with justification.*
    - *Call out the key idea or trick that makes it work.*
    - *Point out where one could go wrong.*
  + *Checks for understanding (Socratic questions)*
  + *After each major concept, ask 2–4 questions to test my understanding, from basic to slightly challenging.*
  + *Wait for my answers before moving on unless I say “continue.”*
  + *If I struggle, give a hint first, then the solution.*
* *Independent practice*

  + *Create 3-6 practice problems covering:*

    - *Basic comprehension*
    - *Procedural fluency*
    - *Conceptual reasoning*
    - *A challenge/extension problem*
  + *Provide step-by-step solutions only after I attempt them or ask for them.*
  + *Example problem solving*
  + *Solve the chapter’s example problems and any embedded exercises:*

    - *Show full working.*
    - *Explain why each step is valid.*
    - *Where helpful, offer an alternative method and compare.*
* *Connections and applications*

  + *Relate the concepts to earlier topics and to later topics I might see.*
  + *Give 2–3 real or applied contexts (even if simplified) where the ideas are useful.*
  + *Review and summary*
  + *End with:*

    - *A concise bullet-point summary of the main takeaways.*
    - *A “formula/identity/technique” cheat sheet.*
    - *A list of minimal core exercises to master the chapter.*
* *Personalization*

  + *Before starting, ask me:*

    - *My current course/level and goals.*
    - *How deep you should go (intuitive vs. rigorous).*
    - *Whether to include proofs, and how formal.*
    - *Preferred pacing and notation (if any).*
  + *Adapt explanations and problem difficulty accordingly.*
* *Rules and style*

  + *Be clear, concise, and rigorous; avoid unnecessary jargon.*
  + *Use consistent notation.*
  + *Use numbered steps for derivations.*
  + *When introducing a definition or theorem, bold its name and restate it precisely.*
  + *If a diagram would help, describe it textually unless I ask for actual drawings.*
  + *Always confirm I’m ready before moving to the next section.*
* *I will now provide the chapter text.*
