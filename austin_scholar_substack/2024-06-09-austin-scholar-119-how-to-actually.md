### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I got a 5 in AP Literature and Composition (the crazy version)
2. How to \*actually\* write an essay
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

Later this week I’m leaving for my senior trip!! From using a multitude of points to book the flights, to debating departure days and times, to making a new itinerary days before the trip, it’s been a pretty crazy planning experience.

I’m so excited and blessed to be able to go on a senior trip with my best friends and make some incredible memories together before we go our separate ways. I’ll be sure to update y’all on the trip when I get back :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I got a 5 in AP Literature and Composition (the crazy version)

I took AP Literature and Composition last year.

Being the book nerd and writer that I am, I felt so much pressure to do really well on the end-of-year exam. I write a newsletter to thousands of people every week. I felt as though I would be a fraud if I didn't get a 5 on this, of all exams. I wanted to take every single precaution I could to ensure that I saw that 5 come July.

Aside from all of the multiple choice practice, the biggest thing I did was make an *extremely* comprehensive template for writing the essays (for the AP Literature exam, you have to write three essays in two hours).

Like, I literally wrote a “fill-in-the-blanks” essay template and memorized it.

Here’s what it looked like:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SC9S!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04df0eb3-7c98-4ab1-978a-8b3c133ba77b_900x1090.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SC9S!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04df0eb3-7c98-4ab1-978a-8b3c133ba77b_900x1090.png)

Yeah, I probably went a little crazy.

But when the test came around, I was able to write three beautiful essays following this template – and I got a 5 on the exam.

A bit insane? Yes.

Did it work? Also yes.

Following that test, one of the things I’ve been trying to do is show people how easy it is to write a great essay for school. They’re all pretty much the exact same and you can use templates and formulas to make it a fast process.

That’s hopefully what I’ll teach you in this newsletter.

### How to \*actually\* write an essay

One of the AP classes my younger sister took this year was AP World History – the test for which includes two long-form essays.

She came to me really struggling with the essay writing part of it. Her knowledge was excellent, but she just couldn’t format it into something legible.

So, as the resident writer in the household, she asked me to help.

I used the following process to help my sister go from 2/6 points on her AP essays to 6/6.

Hopefully this will be helpful for your teens too.

(The format I’m sharing here will also work for “normal” essays, not just an essay on an AP test – so long as you meet the requirements of the assignment and actually edit the essay before finishing.)

The very first step in crafting a great essay is to  write bullet points for your potential arguments. Come up with:

* your overarching idea
* two big pieces of evidence to support it
* one counterargument

Then write your thesis statement. Say something like… “While [counterargument], the [repeat the stem of the prompt – ex. most significant economic effect of overseas expansion from 1450 to 1750] was [argument] due to [first piece of evidence] along with [second piece of evidence].”

Ideally, you'll use your counterargument to add complexity to your point, and you'll use your pieces of evidence to establish a clear line of reasoning.

Next, it’s time to contextualize. Think of your essay like a story – with a before, current, and after. I like to think of the contextualization paragraph as the “before” section of your essay. Start with a stem like “Leading up to this period…” or “In order to understand X theory, one must first understand Y” and take this space to describe the events, the backstory, or the components of a situation that happened before your argument became relevant. Basically, set the scene for your new argument or idea to take place.

After that, it’s time for your two body paragraphs. Hopefully, this is pretty straightforward. Start with a topic sentence explaining the broad idea of your first piece of evidence – this is basically restating your thesis in a new way. Next, start with one super specific example and use one or two sentences to describe it. Set the scene well. Then you explain how your example ties into your main argument.

Don’t just leave it at stating the example, show why it’s important to your story. Repeat the same thing for a second example. To close out the paragraph, explore the effect of your argument on the rest of your essay – how did a new idea, literary device, historical development, or whatever else  change the economic system, meaning of the novel, philosophical understanding, etc. Cause and effect.

Repeat the whole paragraph structure for your second part of your line of reasoning.

Next is the counterargument. You need to start by introducing this new argument as saying something like “X also had an important impact on the period” or “X could also be an interpretation of the passage” because of X. Then use the magic word: *however*, before going on to refute that point or minimize its significance in regards to your own argument. Basically, just explain why you’re correct in spite of another perspective being viable. Close the paragraph by doing another thesis-restatement of “Because of this evidence, X is the most significant impact on…”

With the contextualization as the “before,” the body paragraphs as the “current,” the closing should be the “after” to tell the whole story of your argument. You can start the paragraph with something like “Looking towards the future” or “In a global sense” and then describe how your argument impacted the world or how it relates to larger processes or themes.

This is to show the “why” behind your argument and prove to the reader that your essay has value.

To finish it off, go back to your introduction and write two sentences that encapsulate the themes and ideas of your essay, plus one sentence to state the specific relation of those themes to your thesis, then close the paragraph with your thesis.

And that’s it!! That’s how you write one super awesome essay.

Some overall tips:

* Try and vary sentence length
* Learn different transition words
* Focus on telling a story to make it engaging
* For an AP essay, don’t worry too much about perfecting your essay, just get a solid start to an essay on the page. If you’re writing a non-AP or non-timed essay, take the time to add more examples, edit the essay, and maybe even incorporate counter arguments or nuance into your body paragraphs
* Take two extra minutes to outline your essay – it will pay off

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [Make your Values Pie Chart](https://drdemartini.com/build/value-determination.php)

I talk *a lot* about both how to make a Values Pie Chart and why it’s so important. It can help you create a schedule and life to make you feel fulfilled and truly happy while supporting your work and future. I use it to compare how I should be spending my time versus how I am and to see how my values change over time.

My mom, being the avid Austin Scholar reader she is, found a website for me that allows you to officially create a Values Pie Chart, instead of doing it from your intuition. I highly recommend checking this out and spending the thirty minutes necessary to help you create the life you dream of.

2. [USA Today article about Alpha](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/05/19/ai-use-in-education/73737400007/)

Alpha School and 2 Hour Learning is gaining national attention!! USA Today wrote an article about AI in education and talked about Alpha and how we use AI to learn. Definitely go check this out and take part in the debate about AI’s role in education.

3. [Writing invitations to celebrities](https://talesfromthecollection.com/wedding-invites/)

One of my favorite TikTok trends right now is to send your graduation invites to different celebrities and brands to (hopefully) get a cool response. There isn’t really a guide out there on how to do this best, but I’ve been using a wedding invite to celebrities article as a guide to ensure the most impactful letters. I’ll let you know if I get any responses!!
