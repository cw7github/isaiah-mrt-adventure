### **Hey, y'all!**

As someone who has used exclusively online educational apps to learn since elementary school, I get asked quite often about what apps I use. I’ve tried everything from Dreambox to Khan Academy to Knewton Alta, and I can honestly say that I learn better and faster from apps than I do in a classroom. Seriously – I haven’t had a teacher since the fourth grade.

But I’m getting a little ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I used educational apps to ace my math exams
2. Do educational apps really work?
3. Scholar’s Sources: The apps I used to learn Algebra II

This past week at school was Spirit Week, so I put more effort into my outfits last week than the rest of the school year combined. I got to channel my inner Disney Channel star on Y2K Thursday and reverted back to my angsty middle school self with Emo-nday.

And the drama with the school’s literary magazine reminded me of how *exhausting* people are. No, the solution to fixing our incredibly unproductive meetings is not to just have *more meetings*.

To top the week off, it was essentially finals week at Alpha, so there was a lot of stress.

I love high school.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I Used Educational Apps To Ace My Math Exams

Sometimes, when I'm working through an app, I can't help but wonder if I'm actually learning anything.

Sure, the apps have their own tests and such, but am I just memorizing the content? Apps such as Khan Academy ([Austin Scholar #13: The Pros and Cons of Khan Academy](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-13-the-pros-and-cons?s=w)) are super easy to game and click your way through (AKA – cheat).

See, I know that I can get a good grade on a quiz in an app, but how would I do on a standardized test?

I was so afraid of not actually knowing the stuff I learned in apps that I procrastinated taking my end-of-year tests in math (at Alpha we use Texas Credit by Examination (CBE) tests).

It wasn’t “let me just wait a week to make sure that I’m prepared for the test.” It was, like, *two years* of procrastination.

Basically, near the end of my sophomore year, I still hadn’t taken the final exam for any of my high school math classes.

The procrastination caught up with me (unfortunately), and last week, I had to take the CBEs for both Algebra II and PreCalculus.

I was *super* nervous.

Sure, I took BC Calculus this year – but Algebra? I haven't thought about Algebra since 8th grade.

In the week leading up to the exam, I went through all of the IXL topics, watched all of the Khan Academy videos, and reminded myself how to do linear regression on my calculator.

Seriously, it would be *extraordinarily* embarrassing for me if I did poorly on these exams. I mean, I have a newsletter and everything!

I was really praying that I would do well on these tests.

In my eyes, this was a pretty big test – both for my grades and for the question: *do apps really work?*

It makes sense that using educational apps in lower school works – the concepts are a lot simpler and less nuanced. But high school math – with all of its stupidly specific questions and formulas? Can that be taught without a teacher?

I'm happy to report: Yes, it can.

It has been over six years since I have had a teacher – since I have sat in a classroom and listened to a lecture on polynomial division.

On my PreCalculus CBE, I got a 96%.

On my Algebra II CBE, I got a **100%**.

It turns out that I do, actually, know math. Yay!

I learned math from [Knewton](https://www.knewton.com/) and [ALEKS](https://www.aleks.com/). I put the time in, and I was able to prove that online, educational apps *can* teach high schoolers math.

### Do Educational Apps Really Work?

The question *Do educational apps really work?* can be broken down into two parts: *Do these apps work for* every *kid?* and *Can someone use* exclusively *online apps to learn high school courses?*

The crux of the first question comes down to one factor: ownership.

Let me explain.

As I discussed in [Austin Scholar #6: Teenagers Need To Take Control Of Their Education](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-6-teenagers-need-to?s=w), if a kid genuinely puts in the effort to work through the apps and learn, they can be successful.

On the other hand, if a kid doesn’t care and does twenty minutes of unfocused app work per day, they will not be successful, no matter how “gifted” they are.

In order to successfully work through apps and learn the content, teenagers need to take ownership of their education and make the decision to learn.

The reason why students fail to learn with apps is that they don’t put in the effort. So many teens don’t make the connection that even though there is not a teacher telling them what to do, they still have to make an effort if they want to learn something.

They have to learn to take initiative and do work, even if there isn’t someone giving them homework and telling them what to learn every day. The apps won’t do the work for them. Learning is still required.

This is when you **must** treat your teenager like an adult. Giving them a reality check is sometimes the only way that teens will realize how important it is that they put in the work.

Don’t be condescending or rude, but make sure that your teen knows how valuable it is to pass challenging high school courses and the opportunities that arise from doing so (their dream job, an internship with someone they admire, camps or programs in their field of interest, etc). High school is temporary, so guarantee that your kid doesn’t peak when they’re 16.

So, yes. If **any** kid takes ownership over their education and puts in the work, the apps **will** work.

Now, say that your kid has decided that they will put in the effort and wants to learn through apps. What next? How can a kid learn exclusively through a computer?

First, to understand this, let me explain why, scientifically speaking, apps work.

One of the core issues with traditional learning is addressed through the use of apps: a lack of mastery.

The traditional school system teaches students how to cram and memorize topics and concepts, along with how to score well on a test. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWa48XRnLh0), Sal Khan explains the importance of mastery-based learning and how Khan Academy (or other adaptive educational software) fixes this problem. (I also go over this concept in [Austin Scholar #4: Giving Teachers More Work Won’t Solve Our Educational Crisis](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-4-giving-teachers?s=w).)

The other way that apps remedy the memorization epidemic (the widespread use of memorization, not actual learning, to pass tests) in American schools is through [spaced repetition](https://e-student.org/spaced-repetition/).

These skills are addressed in app-based learning because of the personalization aspect of apps. When learning through an app, students are able to:

1. Move through the content at their own pace and spend more time on the challenging topics (Mastery)
2. See the same content multiple times through Knowledge Checks and other full unit quizzes (Spaced Repetition)
3. Go back through the lessons for the topics that they got wrong on the quizzes (Mastery & Spaced Repetition)

Basically, apps make sure that learning actually happens.

In my case, I hadn’t done an Algebra II course since 8th grade, yet over two full years later I was able to *crush* my final exam. **Apps teach mastery, not memorization.**

Okay, Austin, but what happens if my kid gets stuck in the app? Or if the explanation doesn’t make sense?

Well, a crucial life skill that is taught through app-based learning is Learn to Learn.

Learn to Learn is basically *How can a student use their available resources to teach themselves an unfamiliar topic or concept?*

Teach your kid how to use the internet to their advantage. Is there a really good YouTube video for understanding this concept? Is there a [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) discussion about a similar question? What about [Socratic](https://socratic.org/)?

There are so many useful resources out there, and apps allow teens to learn how to utilize them.

The other two life-changing life skills that students will use as they learn through apps are daily habits and [deep work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/).

By doing a little bit of hard work every single day, teens can fly through courses and find themselves actually understanding challenging concepts. Creating a schedule and an atmosphere for productivity is incredibly helpful.

In [Austin Scholar #8: Work Harder, Not Longer](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-8-work-harder-not?s=w), I go more in-depth on these concepts.

### Some Final Thoughts On Apps

Using apps prepares students for the real world – where there isn’t a teacher assigning a problem set and a book to follow. Not only will teens have mastery over their courses, but will also learn important life skills that they will use throughout their life.

There is such a feeling of accomplishment and pride when you learn something on your own.

I did that. I learned Calculus on my own. I am capable.

### Scholar’s Sources

So – the big question: What apps do I use?

Since I talked a lot about my Algebra II experience in this newsletter, I’m going to go over the apps that I used in order to master Algebra II. I used three different apps in order to ensure mastery of the course.

1. [Knewton](https://www.knewton.com/) is where the bulk of the learning happened for me. Knewton is so comprehensive and goes over every single topic in Algebra II, and then goes over them again. There’s basically no way to cheat your way through Knewton, so this was a great app for me to use to achieve a basic understanding of Algebra II. Read [Austin Scholar #5: Knowing Knewton](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-5-knowing-knewton?s=w) for more information on this app.

1. I’m not going to lie, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is probably my least favorite of these three. While Khan Academy is definitely the most well-known, this app isn’t as comprehensive as Knewton, and a lot of the questions tend to cover the surface-level concepts instead of the complex, deeper concepts that most Algebra II exams test. On the plus side, though, you can take Unit Tests to check for mastery and move forward – skipping over what you know and going straight to the topics that you don’t. Read [Austin Scholar #13: The Pros and Cons of Khan Academy](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-13-the-pros-and-cons?s=w) for an in-depth analysis of this app.

1. [ALEKS](https://www.aleks.com/) is by far the most adaptive app I’ve ever used. Because I did this app third, I was able to take the Initial Knowledge Check and test out of most of the content. Then, all that I had to do was complete a few lessons (ALEKS calls them topics) that went over the holes in my knowledge. And then, I took the Final Knowledge Check and was able to show that I had, in fact, learned Algebra II. Watch out for a future newsletter on ALEKS and its incredible adaptivity!
