### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I (an introvert) learned to talk to people
2. How to have great conversations over the holidays
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been reading

Happy Thanksgiving!!

Parents: one of the biggest causes of poor mental health in kids is that they don’t feel gratitude. Expressing gratitude and feeling grateful is an easy key to feeling happy. My [Thanksgiving newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-40-why-were-teaching) from last year goes into this in depth. Definitely check it out if you want more grateful (and happier) kids.

Not a day goes by that I am not so incredibly grateful for each and every one of you – and Thanksgiving is the perfect time to make sure y’all know that. I wouldn’t be where I am today without you and I can’t wait to continue writing for you as we get closer to 2024 (What?!). I hope you had a great holiday week and that you ate lots of good food :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I (an introvert) learned to talk to people

I am an introvert. Probably one of the introvert-iest introverts you will ever meet.

As much as I love writing and creating beautiful, sophisticated, logical stories with my words, nothing seems to come out right when I actually try to speak. A lot of social situations confuse me and it’s hard for me to stay close friends with people because I don’t want to hang out with them as often as they feel like we should.

And it’s definitely not because I don’t love them, it’s just that it’s hard for me to go out to dinner after a long day, when all I want to do is turn off all of my lights and hide under my covers until the morning.

I have to work myself up for “official” conversations (like when people reach out asking for my help, or when I need help, or pretty much any discussion scheduled on my calendar) and I pretty much always feel incredibly drained after them. My social battery dies *fast*, but I’ve learned how to plaster on a smile and keep standing straight.

Sometimes I’ll hide in a restaurant’s bathroom for a few minutes to recharge, and other times I need a full four hours of watching reality TV before I can talk to people again.

And when it comes time to talk to people I don’t know very well, I just can’t seem to get the right words out. When one of my mom’s friends sees me (which is more often than you might think – I’m pretty sure my mom knows everyone in Austin), I kind of awkwardly stand and wave and say “oh of course!” when they ask if I remember who they are. (I don’t.)

I’ve always been jealous of my sister, to whom conversation seems to come naturally. She knows what part of someone’s outfit to compliment and she can match their energy perfectly.

She’s a great conversationalist. I wanted to be too.

But that’s the thing about being such an introvert – I needed to practice.

So, I started to rehearse in the mirror how I introduce myself, went through my talking points before those “official” conversations, and watched Survivor to learn about talking to strangers from the world’s biggest social experiment. Of course, conversations are never going to be natural for me, and I’ll always need some time after to recharge. But I *can* feel better about those conversations. I can improve my “talking to people” skills.

And honestly, when’s a better time to practice conversations than Thanksgiving?

### How to have great conversations over the holidays

Ahh, yes. Thanksgiving. The wonderful time of year when you have to spend an hours-long meal talking to relatives you haven’t seen for a whole year. It may be awkward, yes, but it’s also the perfect testing ground (battleground?) to practice talking to people.

Now, remember those equations I love so much? Well, I’ve made one for how to talk to people during Thanksgiving (honestly, it works for how to talk to people in general, but it’s especially helpful when you’re trapped at a table during the holidays). And for someone to whom having conversations doesn’t come naturally, having an equation makes it much easier to map out what doesn’t exactly feel intuitive.

The goal of this equation, and of the conversation, is to make people feel like you care about what they’re saying. If you learn how to do that, you’ll become everyone’s favorite cousin, niece, nephew, or grandchild :)

(Which is always the goal.)

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gc2C!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0721cf09-c993-4be3-949f-9313f590df7b_1352x124.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gc2C!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0721cf09-c993-4be3-949f-9313f590df7b_1352x124.png)

Now, this is a little bit more vague than normal, but let me explain.

Body language is the most important part of any conversation. And, it can be the easiest one to fix. For the first part of this equation, pick two aspects of open body language (body language that reflects relaxation and receptiveness to your conversation partner) to use:

* Uncrossed arms
* Eyes on your conversation partner’s face
* Smile
* Loose stance
* Hug or handshake, depending on how close you are

Don’t worry about trying to do all of these things, just pick two and you’ll be solid.

For example, make sure you're not crossing your arms and that you're not looking around the room while you're talking to someone. Or, if you have a hard time keeping your arms uncrossed (because you're nervous!), make up for it by giving them a hug at the beginning or end of the conversation.

Now, for the questions. Questions are a winning part of the formula because people like to talk about themselves. Your family member (or whoever you were talking to) will walk away from a conversation feeling good about it if they just get to talk about themselves the entire time. They’ll feel seen and heard and loved – and interesting! – and they’ll associate all of that with you. The best part? You don’t have to worry about talking too much!!

So, here are a few questions to get you started:

* What have you been working on this last week?
* Are you watching any good shows?
* What are your plans for the holidays?
* I’ve been thinking a lot about my New Year’s resolutions. Do you have any goals for next year?
* I know you’re a fan of [sports team]. What are your thoughts on their season?

Really, a good question is anything that gets people talking, but is specific enough that they can talk about things personal to them, not general (which is why "this weather is crazy, right?" is such a bad question – everybody feels the same way about it, so it's not personal.)

They might seem basic, but in my experience, they’ll get people talking. Make sure to continue adding follow-up questions or switch gears to another question.

A couple more tricks to seem like a great conversationalist:

1. Retell someone’s story to a different person

If you want someone to know you were really listening to their story, bring it up in a later conversation that they’ll also hear.

For example, “Oh, [name] is doing something super cool! [Story they told you].”

They’ll feel really good about themselves after this.

2. Text them later with a follow-up

The best way to make friends and stay in contact, so that next year doesn’t have to be awkward at all.

Just send them a quick text about something you remember from your conversation, or simply let them know it was great talking to them.

3. Find a link

Mention something in the conversation (a resource, a book, an article, etc.), and say "oh, I'll send you a link later."

Then, if you remember the link later, you get bonus points for actually paying attention, and it keeps the conversation going, especially if you say you want to know what they think.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been reading

Here are a few of the things that made my week a little brighter:

1. [The Morning Brew newsletter](http://morningbrew.com/daily/r/?kid=09088aef)

I have to say it again: this newsletter is amazing. I wake up, and instead of scrolling on TikTok, I open up the Morning Brew. Now, I’ll know things that are going on in the world before my dad tells me!! I seriously can’t recommend reading this enough.

2. The OpenAI drama

As I read in a tweet, this OpenAI drama is like a speedrun of Succession. My dad has been going through everything going on with Sam Altman, the board, Microsoft, and all of the OpenAI employees with my sister and I. These discussions have honestly been super engaging and taught my sister and I some life lessons about having power. Great conversations for you to have with your kid.

3. [Lessons in Chemistry](https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Chemistry-Novel-Bonnie-Garmus/dp/038554734X)

I read this novel over the last week, and my goodness, it’s incredible. The main character, Elizabeth Zott, is witty, super smart, and very, very strong. Lessons in Chemistry has actually made me laugh and cry alongside the characters (my parents were both very concerned when I started crying) and this novel tells such a vivid story of beating the odds and going after what you want. Loved it.
