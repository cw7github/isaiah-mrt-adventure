### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: Advice from a Stanford freshman
2. How to help your kid explore potential interests
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

Stanford’s Spring Quarter has officially begun. This quarter, I’m taking multivariable integration, the introductory CS class, a sports analytics class, and the second quarter of German – all of which are super interesting, but not the easy course load that Spring Quarter typically advertises. My class schedule for this quarter is also super different to either of my previous two quarters’ – I only have one class that’s not a lecture, so it’s definitely been an adjustment.

I started Rush on Friday – I’m excited to tell y’all about my sorority experience and the skills that I used to be successful throughout this past weekend, so stay tuned for next week :)

Overall, Spring Quarter is off to a great start and I can’t wait to see what the end of this school year brings!

### Austin’s Anecdote: Advice from a Stanford freshman

We’re back with more advice from Stanford freshmen!

This week, I talked to [Alena Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alena-zhang-78039b24b/), a fellow [Flomie](https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/florence-moore-hall) who worked with Goldman Sachs, Stanford Research, and a multitude of math and English tutoring programs. She clearly worked extremely hard in high school on both her academics and extracurricular activities, so I asked her what advice she’d have for other parents who want to support their child in the same way.

Here’s what she said:

“My parents honestly did the best they could’ve, and with hindsight, I don’t have any advice for them. Throughout my academic journey, they really just pushed me to do my best in all aspects of life, telling me to try my hardest no matter what. They were really firm in that they were serious about me doing well in school and extracurriculars, but in a way that wasn’t too overbearing or strict. I think striking that precarious balance between instilling a sense of discipline in your child and minimizing undue stress on your child is really important, and I’m lucky enough to have parents who were able to do that for me.”

I think her message highlights the [idea](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-151-why-you-and-your) of high standards and high support that I talked about a few weeks ago. Alena’s parents had high expectations for her success both in and out of school, but were supportive and encouraging at the same time. I highly recommend checking out [this newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-151-why-you-and-your) if you want to emulate the same behavior that helped a kid get into Stanford.

### How to help your kid explore potential interests

Update from Austin the investor!

I’ve been reading three articles from [The Rational Walk](https://rationalwalk.com/investing-principles/) and scrolling on my list of experts on X as frequently as I can, and I've learned so much.

In classic Austin Scholar fashion, I’ve written a summary for every article I’ve read and used spaced repetition (review the knowledge every day, then once per week, then once per month) to reinforce that knowledge and ensure that I’m learning.

As much as I love all of the reading, I was looking for other ways to learn investing, and I found that one of the classic ways to learn investing is these stock picking contests to get hands-on practice. However, one of the things that Alpha taught through the multitude of financial literacy is that most games and simulations relating to money teach bad behaviors.

If it’s not real money, you won’t have as much stake in it and it could teach risky behaviors – that seventh grade boy who wants to YOLO it on a crypto coin teaches them bad habits. But when they have to invest it with the “Alphas” that they earn from doing their school work that can be cashed out to real money, it becomes more real – they want to be more careful.

That, of course, doesn’t mean the seventh grade boys don’t ever YOLO it on a crypto coin, but because they lose real money, it hurts. And it ends up a lesson better learned in seventh grade than at 27.

And I think that’s true for so many fields – learning the hard lessons when you’re young and protected both allows your kid to learn how to fail and teaches them about their field in a way they couldn’t without hands-on work.

As a parent, it’s important to be able to support your kid in their interests without forcing a career path on them or setting unreasonable expectations.

So how do you nurture and help your kid explore a potential interest – and do it on their terms?

Well, these are the traits I’ve recognized from my dad:

* Understand their interests

First, take the time to comprehend the kinds of companies, fields, or subjects that your kid is drawn to. For instance, if they’re interested in fashion, retail, or restaurants, you should focus on these areas. By understanding what your child likes, you can more effectively connect with them. For example, I’ve expressed interest in investing, so my dad has started sending me funny posts or articles he thinks I would understand.

* Provide relevant resources

Once you have a grasp of your child's interests, provide them with a steady stream of materials related to these topics. This could include articles, books, podcasts, or videos that they can read or watch and later discuss with you. This not only helps them learn more about their interests but also provides you with opportunities for meaningful conversations. I know my dad is worried that I don’t truly love business, so he’s been sending me things from areas he knows I do find interesting – like fashion, retail, restaurants, and education.

* Be a supportive partner

Rather than dictating how they should explore their interests (a *very* common instinct for parents), offer to be a supportive partner in their journey. This means listening to their ideas, offering guidance when needed, and respecting their autonomy in decision-making. My dad will ask me about how my investing research is going, but won’t tell me what I should be thinking or reading.

* Avoid overloading

One super common pitfall is overwhelming your kid with too much information or steering them too strongly in a direction based on your expertise (something that could be easy for my dad to do). Instead, offer guidance and resources without imposing your own preferences or expectations (just like how my dad sends me introductory articles or videos about investing, not every single book he’s ever read).

* Foster independence

Ultimately, the goal is to nurture your child's ability to explore their passions independently. Encourage them to take initiative, make choices, and learn from experiences, all while knowing you will support them throughout their entire journey.

During the last quarter, I’d been telling my dad that I would be interested in finding an investing internship over the summer, and have started doing the work to make that happen. But I’m taking my first CS class at Stanford, and that’s been pretty interesting too…

So parents, the moral of the story is to realize that teenagers are fickle – we change our minds. Your job is to help us explore and figure out where we’re meant to be.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [The truth behind the Ghibli-generated art outrage](https://x.com/IterIntellectus/status/1905262062764519844)

This post about the AI-generated Studio Ghibli-style art has been stuck in my head since I read it. The premise is extremely simple; it’s a call to remember that “your skills can't remain your core identity.” I feel like kids get so caught up in the trap of making the sport or instrument they play, the class they’re best at, or the art they can produce their entire identity. Because they’re still trying to figure out who they are and what they value, these skills become the easiest way to identify themselves to others.

Unfortunately, this can cause their sense of self to crumble if something happens to their perceived proficiency in that skill – like an AI being able to create art in five seconds that would take them days.

So parents, it’s critical to teach your kid to tie their identity to their values, to the core of who they are. To help them do that, check out my [newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-77-how-to-use-chatgpt) on using ChatGPT to help identify values (you can simply ignore the final goal creation instruction I discuss to only focus on values.)

2. [The Residence](https://www.netflix.com/title/81005297)

Season 2 of *Severance* ending left a hole in my TV watching schedule, and *The Residence* filled it right up. This eight-episode murder mystery series is hilarious and complex – it wasn’t until the last episode that I even considered that the true murderer was suspicious. I loved the cinematography of the show and I thought all of the dialogue was pithy and strong. I’m not entirely sure how accurate the descriptions of the White House were, but it was enjoyable to watch nonetheless and it made me feel like I was getting an inside scoop on life in Washington, DC. Highly recommend watching this (not young child friendly, though).

3. [If you’re struggling in fifth grade math…](https://x.com/LizStepan/status/1903428761803960829)

Mistakenly attributing mathematical struggles solely to a disorder overlooks a critical issue: around 40% of students nationwide are not meeting even basic proficiency standards for their grade level. It's vital for students to address their knowledge gaps before tackling more complex concepts.

If a child struggles with basic addition or multiplication, they will inevitably face difficulties with long division, regardless of whether they are neurodivergent.

While there is significant emphasis on developing methods to teach advanced math concepts and word problems to neurodivergent students, I believe that a key factor in their struggles is the lack of a solid foundation – mastery of basic skills. Once these foundational skills are in place, students will find it much easier to visualize problems and comprehend the underlying concepts.
