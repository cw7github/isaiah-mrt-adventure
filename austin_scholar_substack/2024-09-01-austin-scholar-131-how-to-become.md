### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I learned to be an expert
2. How to become an expert in anything
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

I’m now the last man standing – all of my friends have left for college. It's been hard to watch everyone leave, and I'm worried that our friendships will never be the same. But now that my friends are gone, I'm spending as much time as possible with my family. My goal is for my sister to be sick of me by the time I leave.

To keep in contact with my friends, I’ve created a SnapChat private story where I can send them recaps of my week or updates on fun things I’m doing. I know that sounds kind of “official” for talking with my friends but I just want to make sure I’m communicating with them consistently.

Three weeks left until I’m at Stanford!!

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I learned to be an expert

One of the big life skills students learn at Alpha is how to build expertise.

The first experience I remember having with the idea of  “being an expert” was in sixth grade. Alpha gave my whole class an assignment. We each had to pick a super tiny topic (a card game, a book character, a football team in the last year, a music album, etc.) and learn absolutely everything we could about it.

Once we believed we’d done enough research, we stood in front of the entire school and answered questions about our topic.

The kicker: everyone asking questions had Google, so they could find a super niche website and ask something crazy about the exact score of a football game or why a rule in a card game was changed.

I, of course, chose to become an expert in a book character (Celia Bowen from *The Night Circus*). I was asked questions about her eye color, how she reacted in specific scenes, her views on her sister’s love interest, and more.

Of course, it might seem a little silly to become an expert in a random book character, but it was honestly so much fun – and more importantly, it gave me a chance to practice doing research and building expertise, with a topic I found interesting.

In our next task, we received a completely random (more significant) topic (such as offshore drilling), and had to create a comprehensive learning plan on how to become an expert in that topic.

My assigned topic was roller coasters. I found every major book, podcast, documentary, blog, and social media account on building roller coasters, the history of roller coasters, the psychology behind roller coasters – everything I could think of.

After I compiled my list of resources, I had to create tests to pass that would prove that I had actually learned the content. I decided I’d prove my learning by writing blog posts about building roller coasters, creating a model, and receiving feedback from a theme park engineer on my design. The entire project would culminate in getting the roller coaster design accepted to the next Disney Park expansion. I didn’t have to actually do any of this stuff – I just had to prove that I knew how to become an expert.

Creating this learning plan allowed me to practice making a process to become an expert in any topic I wish to.

This skill, of course, translated to my Masterpiece – when I got to high school, I knew all the steps I needed to follow to become an expert in the teen’s perspective on revolutionizing our education system.

Now, I can answer any interview question I might be asked, write (hopefully) interesting newsletters every week, and find insights in the education space that others might not be able to see.

### How to become an expert in anything

If I were starting from zero, here are the steps I would recommend if you want to become an expert in a topic:

1. Create your Second Brain

A Second Brain is a folder or database where you put all of your research, insights, and knowledge about the topic.

You can use Google Docs, Apple Notes, WorkFlowy, Notion, or pretty much whatever you want as the base for your [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/).

1. Now that we have AI, it’s so much easier to find resources. I would ask Perplexity *who are the top 20 Twitter accounts I should follow to learn about X* and do the same with books to read, podcasts to listen to, documentaries to watch, and studies and articles to read. Organize your Second Brain document into the major topics and put in the resources.

Additionally, once you’ve read or watched the content, summarize it in your own words and bring out 1-2 insights you learned.

2. Curate a Twitter/X feed

After you’ve identified the Twitter experts to follow, create a new account exclusively for reading about your topic and follow those accounts. Then, you can scroll in your “Following” tab and get new content and insights every day.

3. Use your knowledge

To truly become an expert in something, you have to apply your knowledge. Complete projects such as blog posts, reaching out to other experts, explaining concepts to your friends, making TikTok videos, and so much more.

The goal is for you to use the information you’ve curated to do something awesome.

If you’re helping your kid learn the skill of building expertise, I would also recommend giving them the exercises I outlined above:

1. Have them become an expert in their favorite TV show, book, athlete, etc. and ask them 20 questions you found through Google. If they get 18/20 (a 90%), give them a reward of some sort (extra screen time, a new stuffed animal, candy, etc.) and do the challenge again in a month with a new topic. The goal is to give them as much practice as possible in being an expert.
2. Have them make a learning plan on a fun, random topic. Give them 1 hour to make this learning plan (using AI as outlined above) and have them put the plan into ChatGPT and ask if the plan would make someone an expert in the topic.

Becoming an expert is one of the most powerful things anyone can do. Help your kid learn how.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Succeeding as an introvert…](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/succeeding-as-an-introvert-deb-liu)

I’m definitely an introvert and know that if I’m going to be talking to people in a professional setting for a long period of time, I need to give myself time before and after to decompress. Being an introvert doesn’t mean you *can’t* present well and talk to others, just that you’ll need to prepare to do so.

I loved the above article, and I especially loved this takeaway:

“If the idea of self-promotion makes you feel uncomfortable, consider changing your perspective on what this process achieves. Think about it as a way of advocating for your team’s needs and resources, or sharing important metrics you’ve all achieved. When we shift the focus from “This is about me” to “This helps everyone,” the value of self-promotion becomes far clearer—and much more palatable.”

I *highly* recommend that you teach your kid how to display their talents and abilities to future employers or classmates in a confident, non-self-deprecating way.

It’s “cool” to pretend as though you’re not good at something and it’s kind of taboo for Gen Z to promote themselves and their abilities.

The sooner your kid can break free from this mentality and learn to promote themselves and be proud of what they can do, the more successful they’ll be.

2. [The Gilded Age](https://www.hbo.com/the-gilded-age)

After finishing Foundation, my friend and I started another of my favorite TV shows: *The Gilded Age*.

If your kid is a fan of Bridgerton but you don’t think it has enough substance, I would recommend trying out *The Gilded Age* together. The show is a period piece set in America during the, you guessed it, Gilded Age. The core plot is the division between the “old money” and “new money” and redefining what it means to have a place in society. I found the social dynamics extremely engaging and complex and find myself channeling Bertha Russell’s confidence and poise whenever I need to practice self-promotion.

Additionally, the show follows George Russell and his business exploits in securing his railroad business and navigating potential lawsuits and sabotage.

Great show for the whole family.

3. The note in a drawer

My dad texted a photo of this post to my sister and I and said to “consider this as a note in your drawer” and let me tell you, it made me so happy. One of the most important things you can do for your kid is keep an open line of communication – create a space where they aren’t scared to tell you things. The number one most important thing in creating this space is to support your kid unconditionally. I’m not saying you never have to be mad at them, but if they are coming to you for help, do your best to be solution-oriented, not punishment-oriented. You can later create boundaries if the situation calls for it, but during the discussion make sure you offer your support, love, and work together to figure out next steps.
