### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I taught 500 Ukrainian refugees all day while taking Yale classes at night
2. Why (and how) you should teach your kids grit
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

I had a fantastic Presidents’ Day weekend skiing!! My sister decided to grace the ski trip with her presence for the first time in four years, so that was extra fun. There’s honestly nothing I love more than sharing my favorite activities with my favorite person. As I get closer to leaving for college, these moments just become more precious.

I’m actually getting my wisdom teeth taken out this week (another sign of growing up), so I apologize for the shorter newsletter. Definitely ready for the few days of forced relaxation though.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I taught 500 Ukrainian refugees all day while taking Yale classes at night

It was 1:00 AM the night before the first [Learn and Earn 500-person Education Jumpstart event](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-73-helping-500-ukrainian) that I was planning to lead, and I was wide awake. But not for any reason like nerves or last-minute planning.

I had the very first three-hour Yale Summer Session class of my Readings in American Literature course that night. Because I was in Ukraine at the time, the typically-5:00 PM class turned into a late night, 1:00 AM to 4:00 AM class, spent trying to keep my eyes open while impressing the professor.

In the midst of the class’s discussion on Emily Dickinson’s “I like to see it lap the miles,” I was also going over my speech that I was going to give in front of 500 Ukrainian refugees in just a few short hours.

After that class ended, I got two more hours of sleep before waking up, getting ready, and heading to the [Balna](https://www.budapestbylocals.com/budapest-whale/) for the first day of our event.

That was probably the longest day I’d ever had. I’d gotten around four hours of sleep yet I had to be at my very best – to show these kids how Learn and Earn could change their lives. It was pretty hard, but I knew that it was nothing compared to what the next day would bring.

That night, I came home immediately from the event and passed out at 8:00 PM, knowing I’d be waking up at 1:00 AM for the next Yale class.

During the three midnight hours of discussion, I think my sleep deprivation actually allowed me to be a little more delusional than usual and come up with completely novel interpretations of Dickinson’s poetry, so I suppose I can’t complain.

But the next day of the Learn and Earn event – that was really, really hard.

I felt the exhaustion in my bones, but I didn’t show it. I had a smile on my face and energy in my voice. As y’all know, the event ended up being a momentous success, even with my whole not-sleeping thing.

Both the literature class and the Learn and Earn were activities I was beyond excited about. That I wouldn’t – couldn’t – fail.

How was I able to get through that week? Well, I have learned one simple life skill that got me through it: grit.

### Why (and how) you should teach your kids grit

Everyone wants their kid to “have grit,” but no one really knows how to teach it – or how to prove that they have it.

Luckily, I’ve got a few ideas.

Grit is all about continuing to work really hard on something, no matter how hard it gets. According to MSU, “[a] person with true grit has passion and perseverance. Goals are set and followed through.”

So, in order to teach your kid grit, you have to let them work on projects and goals that seem impossible – without helping them.

I get it – most parents don’t want their kids to suffer or struggle at all. And I hate to say it, but your kids need to struggle at least a little bit if you want them to have grit.

*But what’s the right type of struggle*? you might be wondering.

I’d recommend starting with something simple: games and puzzles.

For younger kids (~6 years old), a great “grit-starter goal” would be to finish a 150-piece puzzle on their own. Yes, it’ll be hard for them to complete, but that’s the whole point.

Moving up in age (~9 years old), you might give your kid a Rubik’s Cube to solve or have them learn how to juggle.

If you’re more fitness-minded, you could have your kid run a mile (for older kids, give them a time limit or increase the mile number).

And at the high school-level, have your kid do something they’re not used to every single day. At Alpha, students have to post on their [Masterpiece’s](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-80-what-is-a-masterpiece) social media page every single day – including during school breaks. It’s all about building a habit to do something hard or uncomfortable.

Having grit can help you get through even the hardest of challenges – it’s truly one of the most valuable life skills a kid can learn. It's allowed me to push past all the limits I thought I had, many times over.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [Equation-Based Writing](https://www.equationbasedwriting.com/)

If you missed last week’s newsletter, I’m launching a course called Equation-Based Writing, where I’ll teach your STEM kids how to write well (and love writing!!) using what they know best: equations. You know how I use equations to help y’all talk to your kid? Well, it’s their turn to use equations to learn how to communicate their thoughts and ideas. Sign ups for the waitlist are open – and by the end of the week, there should be an official payment option and sign up form. I’m super excited about this course and hope y’all are too!

“All the knowledge in the world won’t do you much good if you can’t communicate it effectively.” – *Thinking Critically in College*

2. [Thinking Critically in College](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Critically-College-Essential-Handbook/dp/1635767954)

On that note, this week’s book was called *Thinking Critically in College*, which basically talked about how to learn and how to think. Basically, it discusses everything that [Alpha](https://alpha.school/) preaches about learning on your own – so it’s perfect for kids who went to a traditional high school.

Some of my favorite quotes:

“To really learn something, you need to make your brain work hard…strain your muscles more, and they’ll get stronger; strain your brain more, and it will learn better.”

“Go back to basics. All new knowledge is built on the foundation of older knowledge. When you’re stuck trying to lern something new, it might be because there’s something more fundamental that you’ve forgotten or never fully grasped in the first place.”

“Knowing how to think well is an asset that never loses its value.”

Huh, maybe I am onto something about this whole learning thing :)

3. [The Bachelor: Season 28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelor_(American_season_28))

As the newest season of The Bachelor is gaining popularity with Gen Z, there are some super revealing characteristics of the problems of modern dating culture that one of my best friends noticed.

She talked about how, in The Bachelor, all of the contestants are focused on a “connection” they have with the bachelor. But what’s missing from this “connection” are shared values and direction in life. Sure, they might find each other attractive and they like to talk about similar things, but there aren’t any true discussions of their morality and desires for their lives in the show. Obviously, this is due in part to the TV aspect of it, but the lack of a foundation built on shared ideals is definitely something that my generation is missing in relationships.
