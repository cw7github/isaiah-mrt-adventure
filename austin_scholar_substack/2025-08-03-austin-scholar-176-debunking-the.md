### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Debunking the biggest myths about Alpha
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

Honestly not all that much has changed in my life since the last update, but I’ve had a fantastic week. I’ve started working at my favorite bookstore, Book People, eating pumpkin bread at its coffee shop while blasting the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack. How fun is that? I also did puppy yoga yesterday, which is quite possibly my new favorite activity.

On another note, I’ve been planning a bit of a rebrand for my newsletter, along with some upgrades to the paid subscription, so watch out for that! I’m super excited to continue writing and providing insights for you and your family during this next school year and hope y’all are excited for the Austin Scholar revamp!

### Debunking the biggest myths about Alpha

Alpha has been getting a *ton* of press recently.

From the [Astral Codex article](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-review-alpha-school) that circled through the education world to the [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/us/politics/ai-alpha-school-austin-texas.html?searchResultPosition=1&login=email&auth=login-email) published just last week, a lot of people have a lot to say about Alpha. And the reason is obvious: the Alpha philosophy is so radically different from anything they’ve ever experienced or thought about. No one has educated students like this before.

However, the same things that make Alpha's new model so compelling also create massive confusion. Under all of those articles are hundreds of comments from people who object to the idea. They think Alpha students are stuck doing Zoom school with robots, getting no face time with real humans and riding manipulated data about their performance.

To me, it sounds like those comments are coming from people who haven't fundamentally grasped what, exactly, Alpha is – because none of that is true.

This miscommunication in messaging is something that Alpha absolutely needs to improve on, but I hope I can help clear up some of the most common myths about Alpha and its approach that I’ve seen repeatedly in the ~650 hate comments under the New York Times article.

1. **The Objection:** Students are on computers all day and don’t interact with other humans

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9qCC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F617cd769-80d2-4318-8d66-9487cd683587_964x466.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9qCC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F617cd769-80d2-4318-8d66-9487cd683587_964x466.png)

**The Reality:** People hear AI tutors and think “robot terminators” and “no adult humans.” The reality is the opposite. Alpha has *more* social interaction and connection than any other school I’ve heard of. Alpha also has adults – they’re called “guides” rather than academic teachers and their job is to provide motivational and emotional support to the students.

Remember, standard school has students sitting in classrooms doing academics for six hours per day, maybe occasionally working on a group project or discussing a concept with fellow students. That’s no socialization utopia.

Meanwhile, Alpha students only spend two hours per day doing academic work on their computers. The other four hours are filled with life skills workshops where students learn how to work on a team, be a leader, speak in public, think like an entrepreneur, have grit, and embody a litany of other skills. Not only do these workshops teach life skills, but they also connect the students, since they often involve a social component.

Throughout the entire day, the guides serve as an incredible support system for the students. Instead of designing academic lessons, the guides spend their time creating motivational plans and finding ways to connect with and motivate each student to do their best.

2. **The Objection:** Alpha uses AI chatbots to educate kids

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0t90!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbacf7378-9701-488c-a9da-f959b088a2d6_986x432.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0t90!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbacf7378-9701-488c-a9da-f959b088a2d6_986x432.png)

**The Reality:** Alpha agrees that AI chatbots are terrible. No part of its programming uses chatbots to educate students. The reality is that 90% of kids who have ChatGPT use it to cheat – and the point of Alpha isn’t cheating for the test scores, it’s actual mastery of knowledge. So if Alpha doesn’t use chatbots, what AI does it use?

Alpha uses AI in two primary ways. The first is to create personalized lesson plans that take into account what the student does and doesn’t know to create the next appropriate lesson that builds on their existing knowledge. Unlike a standard classroom (where a teacher has to give the same lesson to all 25 students), every student at Alpha receives a perfectly tailored set of lessons based on their current level.

Second, Alpha uses AI to create customized lessons based on the students’ interests. You can visit [TeachTales](https://www.teachtales.com/) to get a sneak peak. Imagine a first-grade boy who says “I don’t like books.” Now imagine AI asking him “what’s your favorite movie?” (The Avengers) and “who are your soccer buddies?” (Liam, Noah, Oliver). AI then generates a choose-your-own adventure story where you are saving the world with your friends, where the reading difficulty is tailored to your current ability. That same first grader will spend an hour engrossed in the adventure.

Alpha’s largest use of AI, though, from a cost perspective, is the vision model, where Alpha uses AI to watch the screen of the student and give the student coaching on how to learn better. Very few students need deeper Socratic debate in order to learn effectively. 90% of students just need the basics: to stop rushing through the answers and guessing; to read the article before answering questions; to read the explanation on why you got a question wrong before trying to answer the next one; to stop scrolling on TikTok; etc. Alpha’s AI vision model calculates what percent of the time the student is wasting by not sticking to these basic practices and coaches them on how to reduce that.

3. **The Objection:** COVID showed that Zoom school/online apps/edtech alone doesn’t work

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8zGj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d080666-47f6-4a5b-a208-17c7f216cf7a_974x474.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8zGj!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d080666-47f6-4a5b-a208-17c7f216cf7a_974x474.png)

**The Reality:** Alpha completely agrees that edtech alone is not sufficient. MacKenzie Price, Alpha’s co-founder, often says that motivation is 90% of the solution. Edtech and AI are just 10%. As I wrote in an [article](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-172-everyone-is-wrong) a few weeks back, most kids aren't intrinsically motivated to crush academics, and that's okay. This is where the guides come in: all their time freed up by not creating lesson plans, grading homework, and delivering lectures is instead spent figuring out how to motivate each student.

For example, one guide knew that a student loved Taylor Swift. So, every time this student completed her math lessons on the app for the day, she and the guide would do a 15-second Taylor Swift dance break. Another student loved this video game streamer, so the guide promised that if the student completed all of his goals during a six-week period, he could meet and play a game with the streamer. During COVID, one of my guides would send a new recipe for me to try after I completed my academic goals for that day. Senior year, I'd do just about anything for a free Chick-Fil-A lunch.

Every single guide is required to find ways to motivate each of their students. Thus every single guide knows the students so well and develops a fantastic connection with each of them. My favorite guide in high school (who would talk to me about a reality TV show after meeting my weekly goals) and I are still in contact and actually had lunch just last week (where we talked about both my goals for the next year and reality TV). The guides and the motivation they bring are the key to making Alpha work.

4. **The Objection:** It’s not possible to learn all academic content in two hours per day

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WYDZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a5b6f0c-1d66-4a07-8af5-52b648220651_970x462.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WYDZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a5b6f0c-1d66-4a07-8af5-52b648220651_970x462.png)

**The Reality:** Data clearly rebuts this complaint. As I [wrote about](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-173-the-science-behind) a couple of weeks ago, Alpha generates results unlike any school in the world. Alpha classes consistently rank in the top 1-2% nationally on standardized tests. According to our most recent MAP testing results, Alpha students learn 2.2 times faster than the national average.

These results simply prove personalized, mastery-based learning eliminates the 90%+ waste of traditional classrooms where students sit through lessons they've already mastered or struggle with concepts they're not ready for. Two hours is all it takes to get *better* results, when they’re quality hours.

These were the most common themes I have seen in the New York Times comments, but they are by no means the only complaints. I would love to address as many as I can, though, so if you have any additional questions, I would love to help out. You can either comment under this newsletter or reach out to me on Substack DMs. As you know, Alpha is one of my favorite topics, so I’d be happy to chat.

If there’s one thing I wish that every reader of the NYT article would take away, it’s this:

Alpha uses AI in education so that **kids can crush academics in only two hours per day**, which gives kids their time back to work on things they love, connect with others, and learn life skills.

The AI apps might be the flashiest part of the school, but flashiness is not the end goal. Instead, AI use creates the time for pursuing other goals of teaching kids how to be genuine, kind, successful, prepared people.

Hopefully this has been helpful! I’m excited to see the next Alpha headlines and read the next set of comments.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [The Richest Man In Babylon](https://www.amazon.com/Richest-Man-Babylon-George-Clason/dp/1505339111)

*The Richest Man In Babylon* was my favorite book I read this week. It’s essentially a collection of short stories filled with financial advice. What makes it unique, in my opinion, is that the writing style and tone of the book is one of fables and religious stories. This gives the reader the sense that they are learning moral lessons, as the stories reflect those in the Bible or Aesop’s Fables. It kind of signals to your brain that these are extremely important lessons and, to be a moral person, you have to act in accordance with them.

The book itself is an extremely quick read (~100 pages), so I definitely recommend reading it yourself, but here are some of the lessons taught:

* Always save at least 10% of what you’re paid
* Make your gold work for you
* Learn to make work fun
* If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is
* Don’t ask a brick mason for information on jewels

2. [The F1 movie](https://www.formula1.com/en/page/apple-original-films-f1-movie)

I know the F1 movie has been out for over a month and I’m definitely late to the party, but I watched the movie for the first time earlier this week and haven’t stopped thinking about it. The main character, Sonny Hayes, is a masterclass in how to be a leader and bring people together. One of my favorite parts of the movie is how Hayes convinces the entire APX team to run the race track with him the morning before the race and how he creates tons of moments for team bonding. It’s both heartwarming and a reminder of the importance of a strong team culture and bond to be successful.

3. Valuation techniques [+ Claude](https://x.com/TrungTPhan/status/1950184325057507447)

As I’ve read a lot of books on different valuation techniques, the number one thought in my head has been *can’t AI do this for me?* So when I saw Claude’s video on creating financial documents and analysis, I knew I had to try it out. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L54MdBeOWzx-U1I2XIIjsylWmUJgAJNk/view?usp=sharing) is the DCF analysis Claude provided on Amazon after less than a minute of thinking. Of course, to be more accurate, I’d need to provide Claude with more information, and I haven’t done a valuation on Amazon myself nor do I know enough about how AWS (Amazon’s number one key value driver) will perform in the coming years (definitely doesn’t seem as positive as Claude believes) but Claude did complete a great DCF analysis for me to work off of.

Over the next week, I plan to use Claude to use different valuation techniques to create analyses for companies I’m interested in and use those valuations to begin to figure out what my own technique will be – which metrics I think are important for each company and how I forecast future earnings. I’m so lucky that I’ve started investing in the age of AI because it can do a lot of the hard work for me!
