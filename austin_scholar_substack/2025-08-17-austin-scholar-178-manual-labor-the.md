### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Manual labor: the summer reset I didn't know I needed
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

My sister is now a senior at Alpha High! I’m so proud of the woman that she’s become and can’t wait to watch her as she transitions to her next chapter in life (which is hopefully at Stanford with me).

My friends have also started to head back to school, so I now have a lot of time alone to think about doing the same. I don’t know why, but I’m more stressed going back to school this year than I was for my freshman year – I think I’m feeling a lot more grown up and a bit more pressure to figure out what I want to do with my life.

As Taylor Swift (can’t wait for her new album!) said: I’m just a girl trying to find her place in this world.

### Manual labor: the summer reset I didn't know I needed

Here's a curveball for my readers: the most fun week I had this summer didn’t involve reading a new book, hanging out with my friends, or designing my dorm room for next year. The most fun I had this summer was a week of manual labor.

I know, I know. I don’t seem like the type of person who would enjoy physical work. I’m a writer, reader, thinker… none of my choice pastimes indicate I’d be comfortable doing physical tasks.

But when David Perell announced he was filming a documentary with The Cultural Tutor in London, I jumped at the chance to be a part of it. Oxford! London! Documentary filmmaking! This was really a once in a lifetime opportunity for me – and I’d get to be in one of my favorite places, learning from a world expert about how London’s culture has changed over time.

There was just one tiny problem: I had absolutely zero skills that were useful for making a documentary. I don't know how to operate a camera. I have no insights into British culture beyond what I've learned from Harry Potter and applying to schools in the UK. I couldn't even pretend to understand the technical aspects of what getting the right shot meant.

But I really, *really* wanted to be part of this project. I wanted to learn about London's history, absorb documentary-making wisdom, and understand the creative process. So how could someone with no relevant skills contribute?

Simple: I volunteered to become the team's robot.

I would do all of the small tasks that were annoying, but necessary to film the documentary.

To start the day, I was the designated tripod carrier and dragged along as many cases of equipment as I could carry. My arms burned as I hauled heavy boxes up the steps to the Waterloo Bridge, knowing everything I took meant one fewer item for the team to worry about. At the filming location, I would stand in my hi-vis safety vest guarding the $100,000 camera lenses and holding caution tape to ensure no one ruined the shot. If anyone protested us filming (which did happen a couple of times), I would show them our clipboard of location permissions and ask them to speak more quietly so as not to disturb the shot. When we needed more SSDs to store the film, I basically bought Tottenham Court Road out of their 4TB, 1000 mb/s, Sandisk SSDs and became friends with all of the store owners when I came back two days later for more. My primary task, though, became fetching flat whites and waters for the team.

None of this is anything that you’d expect me to do. I had trepidations going into it, but became my favorite week of this summer.

My dad has always told me: "Sometimes you need to become a robot and just follow instructions, no matter how dumb you think they are."

In London, I finally understood what he meant.

If I didn’t turn my brain off, I would be trying to optimize the tasks they gave me to be more efficient, rather than just help the team (who weren’t thinking about the most optimal way to get things done – they were asking for what they needed, when they needed it).

When they were deep in their creative process, they didn’t realize they asked me for three coffees from the coffee shop next to our lunch spot just fifteen minutes before we left to go to the restaurant.

If I had my brain on, I would’ve said that we could wait until we got to the lunch restaurant and I could pop over then, instead of walking there and back with the coffee, then heading back there for lunch.

But taking time to explain the situation and my opinion of the ideal time to get the coffee would’ve broken them out of their creative mindset. When creative people are deep in their flow state, the last thing they need is for someone to optimize their coffee procurement system. They asked for the coffee at that time because their minds were solving creative problems, not logistics problems. They needed a caffeine refuel. My job wasn't to think, it was to execute.

And you know what? It was liberating.

For one week, I didn't have to think about anything. I didn't have to make decisions. I just had to show up, work hard, and follow directions. The mental relief was incredible.

At Stanford, I often lie in bed for hours, mind racing with ideas, scrolling through my education feed on X, or watching reality TV to take a break from studying.

In London? I collapsed into bed each night and was asleep within minutes. My body was exhausted from carrying equipment up and down stairs, running errands across the city, and standing for hours holding reflectors.

And then here's the wild part: after a week of turning my brain off, something amazing happened.

I went to Oxford after filming to scout potential study abroad opportunities, and suddenly I was overflowing with creative energy. I wrote more poems that day than I had in the last year. Short story ideas poured out of me. My mind felt refreshed in a way that no amount of "rest" at home could have achieved.

It turns out that giving your brain a true break – not just switching from calculus to TikTok, but actually turning it OFF – is like hitting a reset button on your creativity.

Look, I'll be honest: if this opportunity hadn't involved London and working with people I admire, I never would have signed up for a week of manual labor. And I only lasted a week – any longer and I probably would've gone crazy.

But that week gave me more perspective than months of regular summer activities ever could have.

So here's my challenge to parents: engineer a manual labor experience for your kid this summer. Yes, even (especially) your bookish, indoor, screen-addicted kid like me.

**How to find manual labor opportunities for your kid:**

**1. Start with your network**

* Text your friends or family members: "Do you know anyone who needs help with a physical project for a week?"
* Offer your kid up as a personal assistant for a week (especially for someone who will require lots of errand-running or coffee-fetching)

**2. Have your kid look for opportunities that would interest them**

If your kid is interested in a specific field, have them look for potential manual labor or assistant positions for short projects they’d be interested in learning about. If they have a specific mentor, boss, or teacher that might have something for them, encourage them to reach out. Some examples include:

* Film/photo shoots that need equipment handlers
* Theater productions that need stage hands
* Museums that need help installing exhibitions
* Nonprofits that need help distributing materials
* A local organic farm that needs harvest help
* A neighbor working on a renovation project
* A family friend packing up to move
* A summer camp that needs a volunteer

**3. Create financial incentives**

This is the most important part. Create some form of external motivation to kick-start this project. For me, going to London was my motivation – and it was a fantastic one.

* Offer to pay them or promise a different reward they actually want
* Frame it as a "gap week challenge" with a prize at the end

[Here](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-172-everyone-is-wrong) is a newsletter I wrote about extrinsic motivation and [here](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-41-yes-you-should) is one about bribing your kid.

**The key is finding something that:**

* Forces them to turn their brain off and follow instructions
* Is physically demanding enough to tire them out
* Has a clear end date
* Ideally connects to something they're interested in (even tangentially)

**The unexpected benefits your kid will discover:**

1. **Mental reset**: True cognitive rest that scrolling can't provide
2. **Satisfaction of physical tiredness**: They'll sleep better than they have in months
3. **Perspective**: Suddenly, studying doesn't seem so bad
4. **Confidence**: "I survived a week of manual labor" is a weirdly powerful feeling
5. **Stories**: They'll have a great experience to talk about and will probably make connections in an industry that interests them.

Would I want to do manual labor full-time? Absolutely not. But that week in London taught me something important: sometimes the best thing for your brain is to turn it completely off.

Your kid might hate you for the first two days. But by day seven, they might just thank you.

Or at least they'll sleep really, really well.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [More Money Than God](https://www.amazon.com/More-Money-Than-God-Relations/dp/0143119419/ref=sr_1_1?crid=ZZ4NE2POVRHY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.UjU6epuP4RJQoPi28YdUTR1Ju94A6KfZ8GLzlbdfIs5aeGkkJHqatpu_i2ZQlZUNcSNFVQKYgU9c7blbhxzIGWvDj4GZhHT152qT7y10NxfIz7mPVenvgTymy7bSj2hejxduCzaDowdg-Z4esqnT482cCe1tbzzBe28cbVRGjnQVY0WPwdlGVmBy0lXmV-_ewMPxo8QOoCIO5qeCO6T1urCF2RbMdBm95gxjHceXd2k.ddzf-dDVxsYs0w9B-6BYeEVGB3eQc7i4J6x4o4h_u1g&dib_tag=se&keywords=more+money+than+god&qid=1754343882&s=books&sprefix=more+money+than+god%2Cstripbooks%2C123&sr=1-1)

*More Money Than God* is a fantastic, comprehensive book about the history of hedge funds and their founders. While I knew what hedge funds were previously, this book highlighted a really interesting tension that emerges in a lot of hedge funds. Basically, the original purpose of a hedge fund was to invest both long and short (basically betting both for and against the market) with leverage (borrowing money) in order to have a profit no matter how the market performs. However, most of the big hedge funds described in *More Money Than God* fell into a trap of hubris – they had a lot of success early on and became over confident and ended up leveraging a ton of money because they were sure they were right. While this worked for some investments (ex. When Soros bet against the British pound), it massively blew up for others (ex. When Long-Term Capital Management bet on Russian bonds) and because of the massive leverage (from 30- or 50-to-1) the funds collapsed. It goes to show that while overconfidence when leveraging can make you win big, the losses are even worse.

One more exciting thing that happened when I read this book: I already knew a lot of what was written! Because of some of the other books I’ve read (*How to Invest*, *Long, When Genius Failed,* and *Built to Last*), I’ve learned about a lot of the people, companies, and funds mentioned in this book. *More Money Than God* also quoted Andy Grover a couple of times, who I had just read about in *Measure What Matters*, a book about the OKRs system. I love when a new book references something I’ve previously read about because it signals that I truly am building a great foundation in my expertise on investing. I’m so excited for the next time I get to read something I already know about!

2. [The Ascent of Money](https://www.amazon.com/Ascent-Money-Financial-History-World/dp/0143116177/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1J7HXVMEEENKI&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WbFb-xlOJULueLd_JQpbui0OBxtFftHX_u3RAOgcbNHRCg5cxTc7_INHaCbuuOasPkebKuuwibdsUq4GW88vzg_MhQMQMNUWYAvw2koSlvShhoK-Dhzbul2VAYzKuR5TW2sl1kIxOfzsndCb5YamIOkRkMz-tTqTWVmFm--FsoviFNudAKdDZIpCTRQG0ZLg63zKOuv4Zn2wzaLVuNeT8R_0pvTZhUG2LI9ZYFFiAaM.OMKTA5TNFiAeEnCiwCxY509X-ih6xGCH4KE7sn-eKOs&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+ascent+of+money&qid=1754343870&s=books&sprefix=the+ascent+of+money%2Cstripbooks%2C130&sr=1-1)

*The Ascent of Money* by Niall Ferguson traces the evolution of finance from ancient civilizations to modern times, showing how financial innovation has been central to human progress. *The Ascent of Money* describes so many incredible stories, influential people (even characters I hadn’t heard of before, like John Law), and the rise and fall of the institutions and systems that influence our daily lives. The overarching lesson in the book is that finance, despite its periodic failures, has been humanity's most powerful tool for mobilizing resources, managing risk, and enabling progress. Understanding financial history helps us navigate both opportunities and dangers in our current system.

My favorite chapter of this book was the original ending (Ferguson added two chapters in 2018 to dive into the 2008 crisis, cryptocurrency, and the changing and potential end of Chimerica), “The Descent of Money.” Along with an overarching summary of the ideas and history described in the rest of the book, Ferguson uses an analogy of evolution and the rule of the survival of the fittest to describe financial history. It got me thinking about how, despite all of the vibrant stories of murderers, cheats, thieves, and institutions throughout the book, it all comes down to the fact that humans create human processes – that no matter how fantastical or innovative we think a system is, it will end up following natural laws defined by our human nature.

3. [College application advice](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-112-my-complete-resource)

College applications have been on my mind quite a lot recently, as my younger sister is applying to college this fall! Of course, while I hope more than anything that she joins me at Stanford, I'm doing my best to make sure I’m not putting any additional pressure on her that she *has* to get into Stanford. But honestly, there’s no one that I believe in more – she’s already way more impressive than I was in my senior year.

While helping my sister, I’ve been using a lot of tips and general advice that I wrote in my newsletter a little over a year ago. I created a massive guide on how to get into the college of your dreams and I *highly* recommend reading it if you have a high schooler.

The guide has clear steps for each year of high school and a ton of resources to create the best possible application to impress admissions officers. If you have any questions about the guide or want personalized advice for your kid, reach out on Substack DMs or respond to this newsletter. I’d love to help!
