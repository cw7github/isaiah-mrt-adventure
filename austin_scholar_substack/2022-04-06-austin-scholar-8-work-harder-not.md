### Austin’s Anecdote

Alpha doesn't have a "bell" that rings, telling us when class is out. There's no one telling us when it's time to switch from Science to Math. All we know is that we have ambitious goals to meet every week and we have to figure out how to get from Point A to Point B.

I’m not going to lie, though: sometimes it can be really hard to focus during the day and meet my goals. When I’m working at a table with my friends and I get stuck on a math problem, it is really easy for me to choose to talk to my friends over struggling through calculus.

One of the things that Alpha students have to learn is how to balance our freedom and agency over our education and creating enough structure so that we meet our academic goals.

 In order to encourage this balance, the Alpha students and guides worked together to create the [Pomodoro](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) Room. (*The Pomodoro technique is a time management technique that alternates between focused work sessions and frequent short breaks in order to maximize concentration and minimize fatigue.*)

Essentially, the main room of the building was transformed into a quiet workspace, complete with a [Pomodoro timer](https://pomodorokitty.com/) (25 minutes of deep work, 5 minutes of break) throughout the work blocks. This completely transformed the energy and overall focus of the school day.

Before, a lot of kids would be daunted by the hours without instruction and would get bored after only a couple of minutes, consequently resorting to staring at their computer screen for the rest of the day (To all of my friends, sorry for calling y’all out, but you know it’s the truth :) ).

Now, because of the Pomodoro Room, instead of being overwhelmed with the time, we only have to plan for 25 minutes. These smaller chunks of time allow us to be extremely productive during the work time because we know that it’s not much longer until a break.

To further illustrate the impact of the Pomodoro Room, I would like to mention that it is 100% optional to work in this room. And yet, around 75% of Alpha high schoolers *choose* to work in the Pomodoro Room every day. (See *[Austin Scholar #6: Teenagers Need To Take Control of Their Education](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-6-teenagers-need-to?s=w)* for a deeper dive into choice)

Productivity across the board has increased dramatically and all of my friends have learned how to work diligently and check goals off of their To-Do lists.

### Teenagers Should Learn How To Work Harder, Not Longer

The creation of the Pomodoro Room has forced me to evaluate how to best aid high schoolers in building a concrete work ethic. Well, to start, what even is “work ethic?” In my life, I see work ethic as having **a strong mindset, drive, and plan to work intensely and consistently to meet goals**.

It can be pretty challenging to know where to start with improving work ethic, and can also be overwhelming because a lot of teens think that having a strong work ethic means working 24/7, when in reality, it is more beneficial to learn how to be productive and intense for smaller periods of time than semi-focused for long periods of time.

Spending six hours every night working on homework only half-focused does nothing more for grades than spending three hours of intense focus. **Work harder, not longer.**

### Three Tips on Improving Work Ethic: Teenager Edition

#### Focus and Intensity

Learning how to do [deep work](https://www.heroic.us/optimize/pn/deep-work-cal-newport) is an incredibly important life skill for everyone to know, but can be hard to teach. The best way I have found to learn this is to set a small, manageable goal that I can achieve within a short period of time. Then, because the goal I set for myself seems doable and simple, it is much easier for me to tell myself that I have to complete the goal in one sitting. And then, even if I only complete one or two smaller tasks, at least I ended up making progress on a bigger goal.

On the other hand, setting big goals for myself each day can be super demotivating because I can get overwhelmed and, consequently, will just not work at all.

**Shorter bursts of intense work (like the Pomodoro technique) through setting small goals is more valuable than hours of procrastinating on a big goal.**

#### Habits and Consistency

Creating habits of work periods or focus blocks takes the choice of “Should I work right now?” away. Building a daily schedule of when you are going to work, and then sticking to it, allows the work times to become routine instead of being forced.

For example, I know that Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday I stay at school for an additional two hours to ensure that I meet my weekly goals. While at the beginning of the school year, I hated staying so late every day, especially when the workload was lighter, at this point it doesn’t even cross my mind to go home before 6:00 on those days. This schedule has allowed me to meet my goals every week and have six extra hours of focused work at school. I don’t have to make the decision that I am going to do school work; I only have to decide what I am going to work on.

Additionally, because of how much work I get done during these focus blocks, I have been able to use weekends to rest and recuperate, instead of doing school work.

#### Incentives and Rewards

I’m not going to lie: it can be challenging to make the initial decision to work harder, especially for teenagers. This is where incentives and rewards come in. These treats don’t have to be anything crazy, just a little something to help kickstart the work.

For me, I am really motivated by food. So, whenever I have a tough goal or simply do not feel like working, I go to Royal Blue Grocery and buy an everything bagel and some candy. Then, I portion my treats throughout the work period. If I have a 30 question Calculus quiz to go through that I’m dreading, I will let myself eat a couple of pieces of candy every five questions I answer. And then once I finish the test, I can eat the bagel.

Using rewards can also help when beginning to build work habits. And then, once the habits are built, the frequency of needing an incentive to begin working goes down.

Of course, these tips are useless without having the proper motivation and drive to actually use them. See Scholar’s Sources for resources on having an “I’m willing to work harder” or “Get it done” mindset.

Remember: A good work ethic doesn’t mean working all of the time, rather learning how to make the most of the time you do work.

Parents: If your kid is spending all their time on homework, comment on this post or send me a message and I would love to provide specific advice on how to dramatically reduce the time they spend working, while also helping them increase how much they are learning.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWnC5QM75oQ) discusses the mindset of some of the world’s greatest, including Elon Musk and Michael Phelps. While the video doesn’t really provide concrete tips or practices, overall themes and ideas such as having a “why” and unwavering commitment can help in increasing the drive and passion to work hard.

The first time I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgDVkua8OZs), I was in sixth grade and struggling to find motivation during the second half of the year. The head of Alpha at the time loved to find the most random, insane motivational videos for us each week, and one of the videos he showed us was the Jay Williams–Kobe Bryant video. This is seriously one of the most inspiring videos I have ever watched and after watching it, all I can remember is how much I wanted to be like Kobe Bryant. This is quite possibly my favorite video of all time and definitely a video I would recommend sending to your kids :)

“...I saw you come in. And I wanted you to know that it doesn’t matter how hard you work, I’m willing to work harder than you.”

[This great article](https://collegeinfogeek.com/how-to-focus/) contains super concrete practices and habits in order to increase productivity and create a strong work ethic. Picking one big goal each day is something that I have been doing since fifth grade when I was introduced to the “Big Rock” concept, and has helped me build the habit of working on at least one goal every day. There are a ton of other great tips in this article that are extremely helpful in learning how to maximize productivity each day.
