### **Hey, y'all!**

Welcome to the Austin Scholar newsletter! To all of my new subscribers, I'm so excited and grateful that y'all are here! To all of my returning subscribers, welcome back, and thank you for the continued support.

Please forward this newsletter to other parents who want to learn ways to help make twelve years of school less painful and more fulfilling for their children.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. The accounting disaster of sixth grade
2. The importance of balance
3. Three sources providing more examples of an unbalance and how to create balance

While the [previous newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-8-work-harder-not?s=w) outlined the importance of having a strong work ethic and was focused on the “work hard” portion of life, this newsletter is about **balance**.

### Austin’s Anecdote

In sixth grade, I got accepted into Austin Community College.

The head of Alpha at the time, a person who, even to this day, believes in kids’ potential more than anyone else, had allowed all of the middle schoolers to take the entrance exam for ACC to show the kids and their parents how much kids were truly capable of.

After my acceptance, I decided that I wanted to take a college course, and my dad suggested accounting. I was thrilled by the idea of taking such an advanced course, and also totally wanted to brag to my friends that I was able to take a *college class*.

My dad was motivated by the idea that, if a bunch of middle schoolers can get into a college, kids really can do anything. So, he encouraged me to get an A in the course. Also during this time, I was trying to finish 8th grade math on [ALEKS](https://www.aleks.com/), write three book reports, pass my public speaking requirements (give a TED-style talk in front of the entire school), finish all of my spelling assignments, write a 10,000-word epilogue to one of my favorite books, and sell my dad’s iPhone on eBay (I was scammed three separate times). All in four months. And I was eleven years old.

Clearly, I was exhausted. But, I had these goals and I really, *really* wanted to meet them. Whether my motivation was to impress myself, my parents, or my friends, I just felt like I couldn’t fail, regardless of how tired I was.

And thus began my journey of staying at school with CC, my Alpha guide (which is what we call teachers), who is incredibly kind and helped me on both accounting and math until 9:00 PM every day of the week. Seriously: CC and I practically lived at school.

On Monday I would read the chapter from the accounting textbook, on Tuesday I would make chapter flashcards, on Wednesday I would complete the first assignment, on Thursday the second, and on Friday I would take the chapter quiz. Over the weekend, my babysitter and I spent over seven hours completing the homework: filling in hundreds of tables and balance sheets. To add to this mountain of work, this was also my first college course, so I had no idea what to expect or what was required. I was learning completely new concepts every single day and was trying to find a way to fit all of this information into my head.

Not only was I taking accounting, but I also had to spend two hours every day working through my math course and the rest of my waking hours writing my reports, memorizing spelling words, and practicing my speech in order to meet the rest of my goals.

I couldn’t *move* at the end of every day. But I kept going forward.

But by the end of it, by the end of this disaster, all of my efforts still weren’t enough. I didn’t get an A in accounting. I felt like I failed. I was done. I had nothing left in me.

The next semester, I did no work. Like, literally nothing. The end-of-semester report showed that I only did **four minutes of math** each day. Four. Minutes. And it’s not like I spent my time working in other subjects either. I went from ten hours of work to less than ten minutes. I burnt out.

Luckily, though, over the summer, my dad was able to help kick me back into gear, and I was back to hard work in 7th grade. I’ll talk about parent-to-teenager motivation in a future newsletter!

The accounting disaster of sixth grade taught me what happens when there’s no balance or value in your life. While I still have mixed feelings about that experience, I suppose I cannot deny that the experience shaped a big part of how I choose to live my life today.

### The Importance of Balance

While it might be easy to read the Accounting story and say, “Wow, Austin Scholar’s life was really unbalanced,” what does a balanced life even mean? A balanced life is a pretty abstract concept that doesn’t have an exact definition, so I’m going to share mine.

> **A balanced life means living life according to your values.**

Let me explain.

Firstly, I would like to highlight the fact that every human being is unique. This means that everyone has different needs, wants, and limits. Because of this, there is no one way to live a balanced life. The [8-8-8 rule](https://medium.com/we-talk-it/apply-the-8-8-8-rule-for-living-a-balanced-life-df62426752b7) might be perfect for some people, while others may need to spend more time working towards their goals, others may need more hours of sleep, and others may need more time for themselves.

Now, while there is no exact formula, I have an exercise that gives each person their own plan to live a balanced life.

---

​​**Exercise: Values Pie Chart**

When creating their Values Pie Chart, each person recognizes four to six aspects of their life that are important to them. For example, mine are spending time with family and friends, actively spending time on my passions, schoolwork, and staying active. After these identifications, each person should assign a percentage to each aspect. The larger the percentage, the more valuable and important the aspect is in their life. This doesn't mean, though, that the lesser percentages are not important; it just means another aspect is more significant in their life. Once percentages are assigned, the next step is to draw out the pie chart.

This is my Values Pie Chart:

The Values Pie Chart is meant to help high schoolers realize that they have values beyond schoolwork. In fact, I realized that schoolwork was only one-fourth of my pie chart. I now understand that while schoolwork and accomplishments are a significant part of my life, they are not the only part of my life. Spending time with my friends and family, spending time on my passions, and staying active also provide value. This realization allows for a more balanced mindset. Even if I don’t get an A in accounting, I still have value, purpose, and fulfillment in my life.

During the Accounting Disaster, my life was essentially 100% school, 0% anything else. This is the core reason that I had such a horrible burn-out after Accounting was completed. I wasn’t spending any time with friends or family, staying active, or on my passions.

> **Living a balanced life isn’t about spending equal amounts of time on each part of your life, but instead living life according to your Values Pie Chart.**

Now, I have begun to spend less time being a perfectionist about school, because even if I get perfect grades, I still won’t feel fulfilled in life as 75% of my Pie Chart focuses on family, friends, and passions. If you are not spending the proportional amount of time in each value, your life isn’t as balanced as it could be.

### How To Begin Incorporating Balance

If you want to spend more time…

#### With Family

* Go on family walks

  + Walking is a great way to get fresh air, clear your mind, exercise, and spend time with your family.
* Watch a show together

  + My family always has a “Family Show.” Whether we have time in the morning before school or at night before bed, we try to spend a few minutes watching a TV show together. Having a show encourages everyone to want to spend time together and provides an excellent conversation topic. (BTW – My family has been watching Survivor :) )

#### On Your Passions

* Find 20 minutes

  + Find 20 spare minutes to learn about your passions, whether it’s watching a video as you get ready for the day or reading an article on the drive to school. This is an easy way to feel fulfilled, satisfied, and productive.

#### With Friends

* Study with friends

  + If I know that I’m going to be studying late, I’ve started to invite a friend or two over to study together. This has allowed me to spend a lot more time socializing and being around other people, while also staying productive. Sitting down and doing homework with my friends has helped me feel a lot less alone.
* Reserve weekends for your friends

  + If studying with friends doesn’t work, then reserving time each weekend to hang out with friends, even if that means waking up before 10:00 AM or finishing homework on Thursday, helps that value to be met.

Comment on this post if you would like targeted activities for more values. I’m happy to personalize a Pie Chart for you or your kid!

### Scholar’s Sources

[Race to Nowhere](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1437364/) and [Try Harder!](https://www.tryharderfilm.com/) are two pretty depressing documentaries about stress in teenagers’ lives and how school can have such a negative impact on a student’s mental health. (Not going to lie: I totally cried after watching Race to Nowhere.)

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xG_M!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e649a1d-7a12-4e5b-99b9-46d45d8e8c20_185x273.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xG_M!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e649a1d-7a12-4e5b-99b9-46d45d8e8c20_185x273.png)

Both of these documentaries clearly showcase the lack of balance in most high schoolers’ lives. This unbalance, this obsession with staying up until midnight doing homework, has become commonplace in today’s world.

While identifying your values can seem to be a really abstract, challenging thing to do, [this website](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_85.htm) outlines six clear steps to take when trying to figure out what your core values are. Personally, I find self-reflection to be kind of fun, so these exercises were pretty enjoyable. Maybe if I had spent a little more time when I was younger thinking about what’s actually important to me, I could have avoided The Accounting Disaster of Sixth Grade.
