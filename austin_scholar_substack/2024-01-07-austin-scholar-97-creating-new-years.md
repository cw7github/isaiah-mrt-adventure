### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Creating New Year’s resolutions for you and your kid (that you’ll actually achieve)
2. Austin’s Anecdote: My 2024 resolutions and goals
3. Scholar’s Sources: Miscellaneous collection of 2024 things

Welcome to 2024!! I can’t believe it’s my graduation year. I’ve always felt like 2024 was so far away – that it would be ages before I had to think about graduating high school, leaving Alpha, and moving away.

But now it’s here, so be ready for me to explore all of my hopes, fears, dreams, and anxieties as I navigate this crazy time – and share all of my learnings (so you can be prepared to help your kid, too).

### Creating New Year’s resolutions for you and your kid (that you’ll actually achieve)

Goal setting: the most talked about topic of the first week of January. We all like to start off strong – setting goals to read four books every month and go to the gym five times per week. It’s good to set ambitious goals, right?

But as we start to fall behind on the number of books read and number of gym visits made, those resolutions start to slip our minds, never to be thought of again (until January 1st of 2025, of course).

Except, we set New Year’s resolutions because we *want* to start actually making changes in our lives – and I’m sure y’all also want to show your kids how to set and meet goals of their own.

So the challenge emerges: how do you create New Year’s resolutions you will actually keep up with?

Well, when you think of having a New Year’s resolution to “work out more” or “read more books”, what is it that you *really* want? Probably not to spend hours in the gym or your weekends at the library. What you really want is to “be the healthiest version of yourself” or “become more well-spoken” (or something along those lines).

But those values are too hard to quantify to be actual goals, right?

That’s where this goal setting system comes in.

Let me break it down.

**First, identify the values or ideals you want to work towards this next year.** If you’re not sure yet, you can either use the patterns you identified [last week](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-96-from-spreadsheets), or you can complete [this ChatGPT exercise](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-77-how-to-use-chatgpt).

**Then, write down a few habits that correspond to those goals.** For example, if you want to eat healthier, one of your habits can be to only have fast food once per week. This is where you can write down some of those “typical” resolutions.

**Decide to do these habits for one month.** One month only. And after one month, if these habits aren’t working out or aren’t helping you get closer to your overarching values, reassess them. The biggest benefit of doing this is that you don’t have to be overwhelmed by the full year – it’s just a short time frame to do these habits.

But after that one month, how will you know if your habits are effective?

Create a spreadsheet.

Here’s an example of what that spreadsheet could look like (using my own goals of feeling more confident and intellectually challenged):

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q8gU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a47d25a-a8b3-4a65-8d0b-f045056c4a09_2494x148.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q8gU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a47d25a-a8b3-4a65-8d0b-f045056c4a09_2494x148.png)

Basically, what you’re doing is ranking on a scale of 1-10 how much you felt like you aligned with that value or ideal each day. For example (in the above spreadsheet), on Thursday, I didn’t feel very confident in myself, but I felt sufficiently intellectually challenged.

Then, average your weekly score. If you have an eight or above, consider that a success. If you consistently have below an eight, you might want to think about changing up some of your habits.

With this strategy, you will not only know that you are doing things that directly align with your values and ideals, but you will also be able to quantify how close you are to achieving them each day.

And those typical New Year’s resolutions? Those are just a by-product. If you work to feel more confident in yourself, you will naturally start to go to the gym more or do more self-care – because it feels good.

### Austin’s Anecdote: My 2024 resolutions and goals

*Austin, what are* your *goals and habits for the year?* you might be wondering.

What *do* I want out of 2024?

* I want to feel like I’m in the right place for college.
* I want to feel more confident in myself.
* I want to have my own group of friends in college.
* I want to be consistently intellectually challenged.

Not only do all of these make me a better, stronger person, but they also directly align with my [values](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-96-from-spreadsheets).

Now, I’ve got these big desires for this year. To start working to achieve them, here is my first batch of habits:

1. Read one book per week (every other week has to be one of literary or intellectual merit)
2. Either do pilates or ice skate five times per week
3. Journal every day
4. Fill out my gratitude journal every morning
5. 7.5 hours of sleep for at least five nights per week
6. Spend 30 minutes on my Equation-Based Writing course per day
7. Get 5s on the weekly AP practice tests
8. Talk to one person I normally wouldn’t each day (can be a short conversation)
9. Spend 20 minutes learning a piano song for my mom and dad each day
10. Do a Sunday reset every week

Numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10 directly align to feeling more confident in myself.

Numbers 1, 6, and 7 directly apply to intellectually challenging myself.

And number 8 directly applies to forming my own group of friends.

Regarding the college goal, I will start to create habits (such as spending two hours each week preparing for college or doing research) to align later in the year.

These ten habits all seem extremely doable for me – and each one will help me achieve my goals. It’s only Thursday as I’m writing this, so I haven’t completely filled out my spreadsheet for the week yet, but if y’all want me to, I can put a picture of my weekly review in next week’s newsletter.

Come February 1st, I will create (or continue) my next set of habits so I can actually achieve my four big goals :)

### Scholar’s Sources: Miscellaneous collection of 2024 things

1. Making a 2024 Bingo card

Probably my current favorite TikTok trend is the 2024 Bingo Card, where people create a Bingo card for one of two things:

* Current/Pop Culture events they think will occur in 2024
* Things they will do in 2024

Both of these seem like such fun ideas, and I’ll definitely be trying them out. [Here’s a Canva template](https://www.canva.com/create/bingo-cards/) if you want to make one with your kid.

2. Sahil Bloom’s goal setting strategies

If none of my goal setting strategies seem to be clicking for you and your kid, definitely check out Sahil Bloom’s [2024 Annual Planning Guide](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-annual-planning-guide), where he dives into a *ton* of different ways to organize and plan for your year.

3. My goal setting newsletters

As a type-A high school girl, I set lots of goals for myself (sometimes too many). Through my newsletter, I’ve taken you through many points in my life when I’ve used different strategies to set and achieve cool things:

One year ago, I wrote my [2023 goal setting newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-46-how-to-set-your) where I dove into the importance of a Values Pie Chart and how to use it to set goals.

And here’s my newsletter on [why (and how) to set ambitious goals](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-46-how-to-set-your).

Lastly, if those strategies aren’t working for you, this newsletter explains how you can [bribe your teen](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-41-yes-you-should) to do impressive, impossible things.
