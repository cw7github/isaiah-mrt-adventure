### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. What I told the Secretary of Education and what you can learn from it
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

I have less than one week until I head back to Palo Alto to start my sophomore year at Stanford, and I’m making sure to end this summer with a bang. Last week, I was invited to speak at a Roundtable at Alpha with the United States Secretary of Education and Texas’s Commissioner of Education. I am so grateful both to be able to have this experience and that Secretary McMahon wants to help Alpha bring its program to schools across the nation. We have a lot to get into, so let’s dive in!

After [the recent podcast appearance](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/joe-liemandt-building-alpha-school-and-the/id1154105909?i=1000723564395) that sent shockwaves through the education community, I didn't think the excitement around Alpha School could get any bigger. But I was wrong. This week, the Alpha hype reached unprecedented levels when U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon visited our Austin campus, declaring it "the most exciting thing I've seen in education in a long time."

Most of my friends have already returned to their college campuses for fall semester, but with Stanford not starting for another week, I was asked to represent Alpha graduates during Secretary McMahon's visit. My role was straightforward: answer the two questions that everyone – including the Secretary – always asks about our unconventional education model. First, can students who leave Alpha actually succeed in traditional college settings? And second, what are the long-term effects of learning without a traditional teacher for nearly a decade? As a sophomore at Stanford University who graduated high school without having a teacher since the fourth grade, I’m in the perfect position to answer.

Sitting next to Secretary McMahon, I explained how Alpha taught me to use AI as a productive learning tool rather than a crutch. I described how the school's approach taught me not just what to learn, but how to learn – using learning science principles to truly master concepts rather than simply memorize them. This foundation is precisely why I'm thriving in Stanford's lecture halls despite not having had a traditional teacher since fourth grade. I know how to prompt AI tools to drill me on topics I missed in lectures because I didn’t understand the way my professor explained them.

I highlighted how Alpha has given me a healthy relationship with AI, in that I know how to use it to actually learn things, instead of simply asking it to answer my homework questions for me. Most of my Stanford classmates navigated high schools where AI use was never permitted, and because of that, they see it as a tool for cheating, not learning.

Secretary McMahon was genuinely engaged as I described how Alpha's model cultivates independence and self-directed learning. I told her about this newsletter – and how my goal is to ensure that as many students as possible can have the transformative educational experience I had. When I explained that my goal is to make this revolutionary approach accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford expensive private schools, she immediately asked for the subscription link.

Secretary McMahon's enthusiasm was palpable throughout the visit. "I'm blown away by what I've seen so far, and I'm trying to take it all in," she said during the tour. Her genuine interest extended beyond surface-level observations – she wanted to understand the nuances between using ChatGPT (as many students in traditional schools do today) versus Alpha's structured approach to AI-powered learning. She pressed for details about how we balance AI use in academics versus life skills development, always circling back to the critical question: How can we scale this to reach every student?

Texas Education Commissioner Mike Morath, who accompanied Secretary McMahon, explained how Alpha's approach aligns with upcoming changes in Texas education. "Several of the concepts that you heard today are actually part of the new system that we will be deploying in the 2027-28 school year here in Texas," he said.

Secretary McMahon's visit comes at a crucial moment for American education. The recently released [Nation's Report Card](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/) shows continued declines in reading, math, and science scores – a crisis that traditional approaches have failed to reverse. "Unfortunately, [after] the pandemic, everyone hoped kids would catch up, and the opposite is happening," Alpha co-founder MacKenzie Price told the Secretary. "Artificial intelligence can create these personalized learning plans that fill [knowledge] holes and meet students where they need to be."

The Secretary's response was unequivocal: "I want to run right out to about 50 schools and say, 'Okay, get your people together, pack your bags, come up here and see what they're doing.'" This is recognition that Alpha's model could be the blueprint for addressing America's education crisis.

But scaling involves challenges. At $40,000 per year, Alpha's tuition puts it out of reach for most families. Alpha has opened sister schools like Texas Sports Academy at $15,000. Texas's new Education Savings Account program, which launches next year with $1 billion in funding and $10,000 vouchers per student, could help bridge this gap for some students. Price is optimistic: "With more of these types of opportunities for families to jump into private education by getting that support from ESAs, it's going to open up more opportunities."

More importantly, Alpha is working to make its model accessible beyond expensive private schools. The company's TimeBack/2 Hour Learning platform is already being piloted with 1,500 public school students across more than 50 districts. One of the Alpha guides, Gaston Griffin, who is working to get the TimeBack program into public schools, reported seeing students improve from prekindergarten to first-grade academic levels within just five months of implementation at a struggling charter school.

If my guide Chloe had told me three years ago (when I first launched this newsletter!) that my Olympic-level goal should be having the Secretary of Education subscribe to help transform education nationwide, I would have thought it impossible. Yet here we are.

For those of you who’ve been following this newsletter project from the beginning, thank you for believing in this vision and supporting me along the way. We’ve come such a long way, but we still have a long way to go.

One book I read this summer, *[Crossing the Chasm](https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-3rd-Disruptive-Mainstream/dp/0062292986)*, described how innovations start small before crossing the chasm to mainstream adoption. They need a beachhead – a proof point that the impossible is actually possible. Based on the discussions with Secretary McMahon and Commissioner Morath, I genuinely believe we're at that inflection point. Alpha's model is ready to expand beyond our walls.

I've volunteered to go to Washington to help figure out how to scale this approach nationally. Secretary McMahon's tour philosophy – visiting all 50 states to identify and share best practices rather than mandating top-down solutions – aligns perfectly with Alpha's growth strategy. "Let's be motivated in our states and with our school systems to inspire them to be curious enough to come and understand what is happening here," she urged.

The hardest part of this transformation is that if your child hasn't experienced AI-powered personalized learning, it still seems unbelievable and too good to be true. Parents hear about students advancing multiple grade levels in a single year, crushing their academics in only 2 hours per day, and developing real-world skills, and they're skeptical. I understand that skepticism. Sometimes, even I can’t believe the results we have.

But the evidence is mounting. One student, Everest Nevraumont, advanced from fourth to ninth-grade reading level in one year – and she isn’t an anomaly. This kind of acceleration is what’s possible when we reimagine education using the tools we have available to us.

As I prepare to help bring this model to Washington and beyond, I need your input. If you were in my position, what advice would you give? How can we make this transformative approach more tangible for parents who haven't seen it firsthand? What questions need answering? What concerns need addressing?

The Secretary of Education called Alpha "incredibly inspirational" and committed to spreading these practices nationwide. Commissioner Morath is already incorporating Alpha's principles into Texas's public education reforms. The momentum is building, but real change happens when parents, educators, and students demand better.

The hardest part about the Alpha program for people to believe is that students can crush academics in just 2 hours per day, and once everyone realizes that, it will force them to rethink what education should be. We shouldn’t be spending *six hours* a day in class plus homework. Having Secretary McMahon and other education leaders see this in action enables us all to rethink how kids should be spending their first twelve years.

This way of educating students isn’t just limited to Alpha or Stanford-bound students, and I feel that Secretary McMahon and the others walked out understanding that, which truly is transformative for childhood across America.

The future of education isn't some distant dream. It's happening now, in Austin. Secretary McMahon has my newsletter. Commissioner Morath has our playbook. But you had it first. Reply with your biggest education frustration, and I'll answer every single email with specific Alpha strategies you can use Monday morning.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Working Backwards](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Backwards-Insights-Stories-Secrets-ebook/dp/B08BYCQBZN/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ZDN2ONDD9M7R&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.3Ru8mjm0xdScKm-dTnA7tyCit1aaFEbmYmavd2H_u0WE1v_ATMTZMpWM0iX6OANaRAe6YMoTQIDMGcrvFh3rniXOyY4Qw5ViwSkwMecz8PT5Q4GHgCljDQzl4dtr__l_Pw8SM-HleoJxtK_AKsZChPYWfMHFKxTFkwBVju_WVtqrY6EHu4J-Ku7RHoRl6lgm35NtYSilH-26BSK31Ztz8l9jcSQTqcSBEKUY7w7CA2Y.lchobpCq_LGkZ4clxb2bZ4gs4LOEW5EBCIluPXl7zWs&dib_tag=se&keywords=working+backwards&qid=1757379816&s=books&sprefix=working+backward%2Cstripbooks%2C131&sr=1-1)

I absolutely loved this book and have actually mentioned it a couple of times in previous Scholar’s Sources, but I haven’t yet given it a full breakdown.

Working Backwards by Colin Bryar and Bill Carr reveals how Amazon’s internal processes and leadership principles drive innovation, customer obsession, and long-term success. The book’s core message is that businesses should define the ideal customer experience first, and then work backwards to build products, processes, and teams aligned to this vision. Here are a couple of insights from the book that I can’t stop thinking about:

Amazon’s culture is grounded in explicit principles like customer obsession, ownership, long-term thinking, and operational excellence. These principles guide every single decision, employee evaluation, and team process at the company, and are deliberately embedded in hiring, performance reviews, and strategic planning.

One of my favorite Amazon innovations is to start with the end (defining the customer experience) and developing a “PR/FAQ” document: a mock press release and FAQ for a prospective product, outlining its benefits, how it addresses customer problems, and anticipated FAQs. This ensures deep clarity and alignment before building anything.

Amazon uses small, nimble teams (originally called “two-pizza teams”) to foster ownership and speed. Each key initiative gets a single-threaded leader, who focuses exclusively on that project, driving momentum and accountability.

Amazon values clear thinking and communication. Instead of PowerPoints, teams write six-page narrative memos for proposals and reviews to foster deep analysis.

Experimentation is encouraged. Failure is treated as a necessary part of innovation, not something to punish but to learn from. Every idea is stress-tested before resources are deeply committed, often using written documentation and feedback loops to iteratively refine plans.

I loved this book so much and I think the values and exercises from Amazon could be transformed into activities for your kid, so keep an eye out for a newsletter on how to act like an Amazonian :)
