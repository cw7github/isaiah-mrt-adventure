### **Hey, y'all!**

Welcome back to the Austin Scholar newsletter! At the time I sent out this newsletter, I was still working on getting my Substack reinstated, but that did not hinder my writing. I continued to send weekly newsletters from Austin Scholar, and now that I am sixteen I am able to re-publish those newsletters onto Substack. Apologies for the inconvenience and I thank you for your support and patience.

Today from Austin Scholar...

1. Giving Teachers More Work Won’t Solve Our Educational Crisis: A critique on a paper by the Carnegie Corporation.
2. An anecdote about my friend and me that reveals the benefits of having a personalized learning plan.
3. Three sources displaying current concerns with our outdated educational system.

### Giving Teachers More Work Won’t Solve Our Educational Crisis

In 2020, the Carnegie Corporation, a foundation that supports educational programs across the United States, wrote a [twenty-page paper](https://media.carnegie.org/filer_public/12/33/1233aa0d-9c47-4393-91e5-d88611f968f2/transforming_education_for_a_rapidly_changing_world-vision.pdf) outlining the current problems in the education system and the solutions to those problems.

The paper described how "many traditional modes of learning in school are ill-suited to what today’s students need to know and be able to do." To help education evolve and change with the rest of the world, schools must "deeply personalize learning" and "focus on the mastery of core skills and knowledge." These words could not be more true in today's world.

The solution the Carnegie Corporation offered, though, is unfeasible and will not help education evolve: "Our best hope for achieving equity and the transformation of student learning is to enhance adults’ ability to contribute to that learning." The Carnegie Corporation goes on to describe how increasing the involvement of teachers in education is the future of education.

To meet the goals of "deeply personalized and mastery-based learning," each individual student would need their own teacher. Their learning path would have to constantly adapt and change to align with the student's mastery level. If there is a classroom of twenty students and one teacher and five students have mastered the concept being taught, five are missing the fundamentals required to understand the concept, and ten are in the right place, who does the teacher accommodate? If the teacher aligns the lesson with the majority, half of the students are not gaining or learning anything from the lesson: five are bored and five don't understand anything that is being taught.

**This is what the classroom looks like:**

The solution the Carnegie Corporation offered to fix this problem, which consists of involving the teachers even more in students' education, would require the teachers to create an individual learning plan for every student in every subject. That is at least 50 million personalized learning plans in the US alone. While theoretically a good idea, in reality, this requires already overworked teachers to need more than 24 hours in a day. This is a completely unrealistic ideal for the teachers of America to achieve.

What's the solution, then, for personalized, mastery-based learning?

**Online, adaptive, educational apps.**

Online apps allow each student to learn at their own pace. For those who are able to quickly understand the material, the apps allow the students to advance to a level that challenges them, and for those who are confused, the apps allow the students to be placed at a level to learn the foundations they are missing. **Online apps give each student a personalized learning plan.**

**This is what the new classroom looks like:**

Additionally, having a portion of the school day focused on learning life skills in a collaborative setting guarantees that the students experience human connection and personal growth each day.

Furthermore, without teachers needing to spend time making personalized learning plans, teachers can spend more time coaching and guiding their students to achieve their goals and reach their highest potential.

The solution to deeply personalized, mastery-based learning is not to force the teachers of America to make 50 million personalized learning plans, but to have students use adaptive apps.

### Austin’s Anecdote

I’ve been using online apps for my entire life. Last year, my friend and I were both working through the PreCalculus coursework through apps. Though we started at the same time, there was not a single time throughout the year that we were working on the same lesson.

Graphing has always been my weakest point, so I would always take a few more hours on the graphing-heavy lessons than my friend would. The algebra-focused lessons, though, allowed me to catch up. The apps gave us personalized learning plans which gave both of us the chance to master the PreCalculus content and spend more time on the individual topics we struggled with, but less time on the topics we understood.

Because we were working through similar content, my friend and I were able to challenge each other and motivate each other to work harder. The collaborative environment let us help each other with the concepts we each struggled with and master the content together.

We ended up finishing PreCalculus at the same time, both of us getting A’s.

As of now, my friend and I are both taking Calculus, and while I’ve mastered derivatives, he crushes limits. We continue to work through the apps, motivate each other, and learn a little math along the way.

In [this blog post](https://afabrega.com/my-blog/our-education-system), Ms. Fab shows how, despite incredible innovation in the last one hundred years, our education system has not changed. Through powerful language and juxtaposition, Ms. Fab calls for change and urges a transformation.

[This commanding Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqTTojTija8) is a beautiful spoken-word poem that clearly outlines the outdated education system and how it affects students. I was completely captivated with every word. The video has received over 25 million views and contains quotes from brilliant minds such as Albert Einstein.

Finally, [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okpg-lVWLbE) sketches out the similarities between industrial-aged values and the way students are taught. The video also highlights the lack of space and time for discovering passions and purposes in school. I highly recommend watching this video. :)
