3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

My sister turned sixteen last Monday, and I got to help plan her party. Since her birthday was on the actual day of the eclipse, the party was Twilight-themed (for the book *Eclipse*) and we wore Jacob and Edward t-shirts and drank Gatorade out of blood bags. Celebrating her was a blast and I genuinely can’t believe she’s gotten so old!! It’s so lovely to watch my little sister grow up and become an incredible woman. I’m so proud <3

### Austin’s Anecdote: How to get extrinsically motivated kids to crush school

Speaking of my sister…

When it comes to school, we aren’t exactly motivated in the same way.

I’m pretty internally motivated and tend to get most of my schoolwork done – and more – without being asked or monitored. I like doing things just for the sake of accomplishing them.

Because of this, the whole “learn on your own with online apps” thing works pretty well for me.

My sister, on the other hand, isn’t exactly motivated on her own. She’ll do the bare minimum she needs to not get in trouble, but doesn’t do much more than that.

Unless she has a reason to.

So my dad started to implement “challenges” for her. If she did something hard, like finish an entire grade level of math, start a TikTok account for Alpha School, or get 99th percentile on the MAP test, she’d get something she wanted (cash, usually).

Doing an entire grade level of math a year early would get her a new phone. Scoring in the 99th percentile of her grade level on a MAP test would get her money.

All of a sudden, my sister did extra schoolwork. She spent time studying for the MAP test and filmed videos of Alpha to post on TikTok.

Once she had a reason, she was unstoppable.

Whether your kid is like my sister or like me, what should you do to support them?

If your child is internally motivated, make sure you acknowledge when they do good work on their own volition. If they already strive for As and a 4.0 GPA, don’t let it become something that’s expected of them. Continue complimenting their work ethic and consider rewarding them with a nice dinner after a good report card, even if it would be more shocking if they didn’t have straight A+s.

Doing this will make sure they still see the value in every win.

And if they’re externally motivated to do school work (or anything else you wish they’d do), try asking them what they *actually want.*

You might not want to give it to them (cash, more freedoms, etc.), but it might be worth using to bargain for the work they’ll accomplish.

Here’s an example of how it could play out on a larger scale:

### How kids at Alpha learned half a grade level in two weeks

If they’re properly motivated, kids can do 50% of an ENTIRE GRADE LEVEL in TWO WEEKS.

(I know this sounds crazy. I’ll prove it in just a moment.)

Many of the education experts in America think the key to increased learning efficiency is to make the content super engaging, but that’s totally wrong.

It’s WAY easier than that.

The secret is just to give your kid what they actuallywant.

If you sit down with your kid and ask them to name things they want, I can guarantee you “for school to be more engaging” won’t make the list.

They probably don’t particularly want to spend all day on school, either.

But, as a recent former kid myself (I just turned 18!),  I can tell you things they do want: money, time with friends, winning something.

So why doesn’t our education system use this more?

Over the last two weeks, my school ([Alpha High](https://alphahigh.school/)) tested this out by holding both a Language Arts and a History tournament for their students.

Here’s how it worked:

The tournament used a bracket format – whoever completed the most lessons in [IXL](https://www.ixl.com/) (a drill-and-kill, not very “fun” app) won their round. In these single-elimination style tournaments, students competed head-to-head, advancing each round until an overall champion was crowned.

The prize? Cash.

The competitors? Students versus their friends (and some “bots” just to make things interesting!)

The results? You’re going to be shocked.

Students went from taking 21 minutes to complete a lesson to just 14 – a decrease in time of almost **35%**. Each lesson had to be completed to 100% mastery to count towards the tournament, so they had to actually learn the material.

And, students completed over **TWO TIMES** the number of lessons in history than they did before the tournament.

Language was even crazier, with over **THREE TIMES** the number of lessons mastered.

With these stats, it’s no surprise that students were able to complete, on average, **25-50%** of an ENTIRE GRADE LEVEL in just these two weeks.

IXL is a boring app, and we certainly didn’t do anything to make it “more engaging.” So why did this work?

It’s simple.

This tournament gave students what they wanted (cash). It allowed them to do this with the people they actually care about (their friends). And it added an element of competition. Students were not aware of how many units are enough to qualify for the next round, so they just completed as many as they could. It gave the students who needed to be externally motivated a reason to go above and beyond.

Our education system needs to stop focusing on the wrong things. Making content more “engaging” is a waste of time.

It won’t solve our education crisis.

But focusing on what the kids want actually will.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [Dune: Messiah](https://www.amazon.com/Dune-Messiah-Frank-Herbert/dp/0593098234)

I’ve continued my Dune journey and finished the second book. I found it to be a brilliant contrast to the first and a true questioning of the “savior” trope. There’s a lot of nuance in every character and none are portrayed as truly “good” or “bad.” My dad and I were able to have a great conversation about power, fate, and control after reading and contrasting these books.

If that’s a conversation you would want to have with your kid, definitely read Dune with them.

2. [Shōgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dgun_(2024_miniseries))

Shōgun is the show my family is currently watching and it’s absolutely fascinating. We’ve learned a lot about Japanese culture and history, power dynamics (again), and how nations view outsiders. In the case of Shōgun, the British people were loud, disrespectful, sloppy barbarians. The culture clash in the show is super interesting to unpack and to discuss how it plays out in today’s society.

3. [My sister's birthday gift](https://store.metmuseum.org/amaryllis-pendant-necklace-80058084)

This past weekend was my sister’s birthday, and since she got me a birthday gift for the first time in her life, I felt like I needed to return the gesture.

In flower language, the Amaryllis flower means pride, so I got my sister an Amaryllis flower necklace that’s part of a collection at The MET to show her how proud I am of the person she’s becoming.

She definitely seemed to enjoy the gift (she cried) so maybe this is something y’all can think about :)
