### **Hey, y'all!**

My parents and I have done a lot of things to build a strong relationship–but the most important one has been texting.

Even though we live under the same roof, becoming regular texters is the best thing we've ever done for our relationship–and it might save your relationship with your kids, too.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How Texting Saved My Relationship with My Parents

I’m a super anxious person. I’ve got basically all of the anxiety disorders (generalized, social, you name it) and am more nights than not I have jittery energy overflowing in my body as I try to go to sleep.

And when I try and talk to my parents about important topics, my heart rate skyrockets, my palms get sweaty, my fingers can’t stop fidgeting, and my throat closes up. I can’t get anything out.

In eighth and ninth grade, my relationship with my parents was rocky because I couldn’t articulate how I was feeling to them. They were reaching out and I was too paralyzed with anxiety to respond.

There were some days that my body would be so full of anxiety and nervous energy that I couldn’t move or speak for hours. Or when I was having a frustrating day and feeling my depression set in, I couldn’t get the words out to tell my parents.

This whole thing created an immeasurable chasm between my parents and me–one that I thought was impossible to cross.

They were frustrated with me. *I* was frustrated with me.

I could write elaborate speeches in my mind and in the shower, but when it came time to speak out loud, the words didn’t come. It was a mix of worrying about what they were going to think of me if I told them how I was feeling and wondering if actually saying the words makes them true.

Then, on one of my hard days, I locked myself in my room and turned off all of the lights. While bundled in my blanket burrito, I texted my parents, telling them I was feeling extremely sad and needed to hide in the darkness for a few hours and not to bother me. They both texted back and told me they loved me and would leave dinner on the counter.

*Umm, excuse me? Did I just tell my parents how I was feeling? And did they listen to me?*

Yes. I told my parents what was wrong and they reacted accordingly. There was no confusion about the situation and every person felt respected at the end of the day.

So I tried it again.

*“Hey, mom and dad! Are either of you up? I’m having a hard night and would love to watch a show to calm down.”*

And again.

*“I didn’t get a good score on my practice SAT and need to distract myself for the rest of the day. I’ll be in my room watching a show.”*

And even when I was mad at my parents, I texted them.

*“I’m really frustrated about this situation and am no longer thinking clearly. I would appreciate waiting to finish the conversation and just going to bed. I’ll write out my thoughts and email them tomorrow.”*

As time went on, I was able to tell my parents when I had a bad day, when I needed their support, and even when I was mad at them.

I think the reason the texting is easier is because speaking, to me at least, seems so final. Official. Unchangeable.

But writing things down? You can do a first draft, then a second, and a third before submitting it. Writing my thoughts seems less permanent, and therefore easier to say, as I’m not as worried about the consequences of them. It’s like the “it’s easy to bully people online” argument, just translated to talking to parents.

Now, if I’m ever, at any point in time, too anxious to verbalize my emotions to my parents, I know I can just shoot them a text. And all of this communicating emotions stuff has made my parents and me closer than ever. And I think that’s pretty cool.

### Advice From Lynn Lyons on Supporting Anxious Teenagers

If your kid struggles with anxiety, you should definitely be following the work of Lynn Lyons.

Lyons is a psychotherapist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders in adults and children and has been practicing for over 30 years.

She’s also an author and speaker who travels globally, bringing awareness to the subject of anxiety and how it affects families–and she’s also written several books on the topic, such as [The Anxiety Audit](https://www.amazon.com/Anxiety-Audit-Lynn-Lyons-LICSW/dp/0757324258) and [Anxious Kids, Anxious Parents](https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Kids-Parents-Courageous-Independent/dp/0757317626). She’s definitely an expert.

I recently listened to [a podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrp9B4Sk4ng) where Lyons gave an overview on how to support anxious teens. The following article is a mix of what she said, what I think, and my strategies for helping your kid with their anxiety.

As Lyons explained in her interview, anxiety is basically when you create a movie in your head about a situation that sends an "oh no" message to your amygdala (which can’t differentiate “movies” from reality). This makes your body respond in a “this is life-threatening” kind of way, which can lead to physiological symptoms like heavy breathing, stomach aches, feeling cold or numb, and lots of other unpleasant things.

If your child suffers from anxiety, it can be tempting to shield your child from situations that trigger their anxiety, but this can actually make the problem worse as they won’t learn how to truly deal with their anxiety. Instead, let them experience these situations so they can realize that the physiological symptoms don’t actually mean it’s a life-or-death scenario.

You also need to make sure that you aren’t modeling anxious behaviors. Your kid will copy you. I promise. Start working on your own anxiety, and your kid will unconsciously start working on theirs.

Your relationship with your child will improve when they see you taking ownership over your own emotions. When you’re with your kid, show them that you are aware when you are having an anxious thought pattern (check out my newsletter Twisty Thoughts for examples of what this looks like) and explain how you are calming your mind.

As you shift your own anxious thoughts, your kid will observe how to go through that process on their own.

Overall, worry and anxiety stem from uncertainty. So instead of addressing the specific context of the problem (for example, "I’m really anxious about this Spanish presentation, so I’m not going to go."), address the process by asking them how their worry shows up (for example, “I’m anxious about this Spanish presentation because I’m scared of failing in front of other people, so I should work on that overarching issue.”).

How you act as a parent can either support or exacerbate your child's anxiety.

On the whole, I completely agree with Lyons’ ideas. As I’m still a teenager, I tend to copy how my parents act. When they react to anxiety by avoiding the situation, I tend to do the same. When they react to anxiety by talking to my sister and me about it, I tend to do the same.

I also love the idea of focusing on the process, not the context. Doing this ensures that your kid will be able to handle their anxiety and mental health long-term, not just in specific scenario.

The best ways I’ve found to help teenagers shift their processes are to observe, discuss, and try. Let me explain what I mean:

**Observe**: Most teenagers respond to other people’s anxiety in the way they want other people to respond to their own. For me, whenever my sister was crying or felt nervous, I would give her a hug and just sit with her. (She really doesn’t like hugs, though, so I’ve shifted that behavior to what she appreciates more.) That’s exactly how I want someone to react when I’m stuck in my head. Spend a while watching your teen, and you’ll be able to figure out how they want you to react.

**Discuss**: “Anxiety” and “mental health” can feel like taboo topics in so many families. If you aren’t afraid of them, your kid will feel more comfortable bringing them up on their own and talking about what they need and feel.

**Try**: Use what you’ve observed and discussed to start trying out different methods of supporting your kid. You’re probably not going to get it right the first time, but keep going. When you find the thing that works, make it a common practice in your family. Create the processes that foster a connection between you and your teen. Make sure they can have no doubts that you love them and will support them with whatever they need. (Yes, they might brush your support off or act embarrassed, but it’s worth it for them to know.)

### Scholar’s Sources: The Best Lynn Lyons Articles on Teens and Mental Health

Here are a few of my favorite articles by Lynn Lyons:

1. [The Parenting Report Card](https://www.lynnlyons.com/the-parenting-report-card-are-you-getting-all-as/)

This is a really interesting take on analyzing how parents act and what they should prioritize in their conversations with their kids. This article has great questions to ask yourself at the end, too.

2. [Teens, Depression, and Anxiety](https://www.lynnlyons.com/teen-depression-anxiety/)

This is a great meta-article on mental illness in teens and how to support them. It’s filled with ways to identify depression and anxiety, information on the link between the two, questions to ask your teen, why they’re acting the way they are, and resources for further research.

3. [Back To School Anxiety: What Not To Do](https://www.lynnlyons.com/manage-back-to-school-anxiety-kids/)

Obviously, I give the teen’s perspective on school and anxiety, but this article explains things from the parent’s side and provides specific examples of what to do, how to act, and what to say to your kid. It also introduces an interesting concept called “momsplaining.”
