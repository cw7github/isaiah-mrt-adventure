### Austin’s Anecdote: My high school contract

The room darkened, with only candles left to illuminate the table with the rolled up contracts and wax seals.

“It’s time to sign your contracts to commit yourself to the Alpha High program and its values,” the head of school said in an ominous tone. Every student, including myself, lined up in the main hall to confirm our places in our high school through this contract. We signed with a flourish and stamped the school logo next to our names. The contract looked like this:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xrzf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe11f906a-d8d5-4941-a765-49bd797b587f_540x720.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xrzf!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe11f906a-d8d5-4941-a765-49bd797b587f_540x720.jpeg)

Dramatic signing ceremonies aside, this contract has stayed with me – been my guiding force – throughout my high school career. I keep it tacked up on my wall in front of my desk so I can glance at it whenever I need to be reminded what I’m working towards:

*Article I*: I own my education. I have control over my actions and over my life. I am accountable for both my successes and my failures.

*Article II*: I commit myself to academic standards of excellence – nothing less than that. (My high standardized test scores proved to me that putting in the work and constantly looking to improve pay off. My Austin Scholar and Learn and Earn successes show my dedication to learning life skills – networking, public speaking, non-academic writing, learning to learn, and so much more. And finally, my acceptance to Stanford made my late nights worth it.)

*Article III:* I am resilient. (This weird, alternative education journey I’ve had is hard, challenging, and has never been done before. I’ve learned how to take my failures and setbacks and learn from them, to do better the next time.)

*Article IV*: I am grateful for this opportunity and will take advantage of every day. (This is very important for me to remember – I may struggle, I may have hard days, but I’m lucky to be at this crazy, adventure-filled school)

*Article V*: I will not lie, cheat, or steal. I will be responsible, loyal, and considerate. (These six values have guided my decisions – when I get anxious or freaked out over making the wrong choice, I ask myself if I’m living by these values. If so, I will be okay.)

My high school contract has made me a better person and encouraged me to achieve great things. To never settle. It’s inspired me, and I can only hope it inspires generations of Alpha students to come.

### The most important values for a successful educational career

My Alpha High contract pushed and guided me towards a high-quality education. Which made me start thinking: what are the values and commitments, within a community or for an individual, that can consistently lead to kids having a good education?

I came up with three core pillars, values that were both supported by my high school contract and also applicable to education in any environment, not just my school: high standards, ambitious peers, and ownership.

Working together, these three pillars create a strong, appropriately challenging environment that will help your kid thrive in their education. Here’s a deeper dive into what they are and how to implement them:

1. High standards

Having high standards creates high output, if done the right way. You don’t want to demotivate your kid with unrealistic standards, but you want them to be pushed – to ensure they’re doing their best work.

What can you do? Set hard goals and then do something I like to call “problem-solve to success.” First off, make sure that your kid has goals that align with *their* [values](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-46-how-to-set-your), not yours. Then, make those goals ten times harder and implement some sort of [motivational system](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-50-how-to-motivate). And if your kid gets stuck or isn’t on track, don’t lower the goal or standard; just help them problem solve.

Work backwards from the problem and see how you can help your kid reach the goal. Do not lower the standard so they’ll meet the goal. It will set a bad example for them and could become a habit.

2. Ambitious peers

As my favorite Survivor player Boston Rob says, *tell me who you go with and I’ll tell you who you are.*

If your kid is surrounded by people who don’t care and don’t want to work, they won’t care or want to work either. Honestly, high standards aren’t effective without having ambitious peers. Trust me – I know from experience.

The reason the [Alpha Rocketship](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-50-how-to-motivate) is so powerful is because it’s a group of kids who are all proven to be high-performing working toward impossible goals. It’s the comradery that builds community and creates the standard of doing impressive things.

What can you do? It can be hard to judge your kid’s friends without getting backlash, but there are a few ways you can help:

* Find groups outside of school filled with ambitious students (ex. [BETA Camp](https://www.beta.camp/)) for your kid to be around
* Ask leading questions in a non-judgemental way to make them think (ex. What do you want out of life, and are the people you’re currently hanging out with the right ones to get you there?)
* Tell personal stories about friends you’ve had that held you back

3. Ownership

The third key is ownership.

As I talked about in [Austin Scholar #6: Teenagers Need To Take Control Of Their Education](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-6-teenagers-need-to?s=w), if a kid genuinely puts in the effort to learn, they can be successful.

But if a kid doesn’t care and does twenty minutes of unfocused work per day, they will not be successful, no matter how “gifted” they are.

In order to successfully accumulate knowledge and understanding, teenagers need to take ownership of their education and make the decision to learn.

The reason why students fail to learn with apps is that they don’t put in the effort. So many teens don’t make the connection that even though there is not a teacher telling them what to do, they still have to make an effort if they want to learn something.

They have to learn to take initiative and do work, even if there isn’t someone giving them homework and telling them what to learn every day. The apps won’t do the work for them. Learning is still required.

What can you do? Treat your teenager like an adult. For kids who don’t seem to care about academics, giving them a reality check is sometimes the only way to motivate them to learn.

Don’t be condescending or rude, but make sure that your teen knows how valuable it is to pass challenging high school courses and the opportunities that arise from doing so (their dream job, an internship with someone they admire, camps or programs in their field of interest, etc). High school is temporary, so guarantee that your kid doesn’t peak when they’re 16.

As a whole, even starting with just one of these core pillars can drastically begin to improve your kid’s quality of and success in their education. Put them all together, though, and your kid will be unstoppable.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

I visited Stanford this weekend!! It was such an incredible experience, primarily because all of the stress of applying was gone and I just got to imagine myself living there. I found my coffee shops and library spots, the classes I’ll take and the places I’ll live. It was all very motivating and inspiring (especially the Berkeley bashing traditions).

1. [The Secret Language of Maps](https://dschool.stanford.edu/book-collections/the-secret-language-of-maps)

When I saw *The Secret Language of Maps* in the Stanford library, I knew it was the perfect book for me. Not only was it similar in concept to Equation-Based Writing, but it also told a great murder-mystery story with the moral being to make maps to find patterns. So fun. ⅘ stars for me.

2. [Greek Myths](https://www.amazon.com/Greek-Myths-Wonder-Girls-Collectible/dp/1435158148)

I know, I know, two books in one week? This one is short, though, so it wasn’t that crazy. Greek Myths is written by Nathaniel Hawthorne and weaves together some of the most beautiful, classic myths in a playful, completely understandable way.

3. [Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs' performance of “Fast Car”](https://www.grammy.com/videos/tracy-chapman-luke-combs-fast-car-2024-grammys-performance-66th-annual-grammy-awards)

Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs’ performance of “Fast Car” at the Grammys changed my freaking life. It’s the most heartfelt, beautiful, unforgettable performance and if you haven’t seen it, you should. (This might’ve even beaten Taylor Swift’s announcement of her new album as my favorite moment of the night.)
