### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Why you and your kid are speaking two different languages (& how to fix it)
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

The craziest thing in the entire world happened: Elon Musk liked and commented on my [post](https://x.com/AustinScholar/status/1881872285512224967)!!

I truly never imagined I would get to a place where people like Elon Musk and Andrew Huberman (he liked my post, too!) would not only see my content, but interact and agree with it. I’m so grateful to all of you for helping me get to the place I am now.

On another note, I had a math midterm this last week and have become *very* familiar with YouTube channels like [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) and [Dr. Trefor Bazett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsUgDpGWk-M&list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxc_CvEy7xBKRQr6I214QJcd) (fantastic support if you or your kid find yourselves learning multivariable calculus or linear algebra) *and* I re-read my [old newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-137-why-math-fact) on creating a formula sheet to ensure I was as prepared as possible. I’d like to think that it paid off, but I guess we’ll see next week.

### Why you and your kid are speaking two different languages (& how to fix it)

Has it ever felt like you and your kid are having two completely different conversations?

“Would you please put away your laundry?”

“If I’m *so messy* why don’t you do it yourself?”

In so many cases, parents and kids have such a disconnect between what they say versus what they hear.

And *that* is the core dilemma that David Yeager’s book, *10 to 25*, tries to fix.

*10 to 25* is genuinely one of the best books on understanding and motivating kids that I’ve ever read – it puts a lot of the “feelings” and “vibes” I have into actual words and scientific studies. This book is so insightful and dense that, in this newsletter, I can only cover the introduction along with chapter one. If y’all enjoy this newsletter, I will happily dive into the incredible discoveries and strategies for communicating with your kid in future articles.

Now: onto this disconnect. As Yeager puts it, “it’s very hard to simultaneously criticize someone’s work and motivate them because criticism can crush a young person’s confidence” (4).

To illustrate:

You want to motivate your kid to learn how to clean their room. When you go into their room, you notice that there’s some trash on their desk.

You have two options:

* Ignore it
* Tell them to clean up the trash

Unfortunately, it’s not likely either of these options has a good outcome. If you ignore it, it will just signal to your kid that they don’t *really* need to clean their desk after all. But if you say something, your kid might actually hear “nothing I do is good enough” or “why can’t my parents respect that I did my best? I’m so busy that I don’t have time to do everything perfectly,” causing them to give up on cleaning their room completely.

But as Yeager so articulately puts it, “the adolescent predicament…is simply defined as the mismatch between young people’s neurobiological needs for status and respect and the level of status or respect afforded to them by their current circumstances” (45).

*10 to 25* draws on a ton of studies which illustrate that so much of puberty and adolescent years are determined by kids’ desire for respect and social status – it’s not that they’re incompetent, they just have different priorities than adults. If your kid is going to have peers or friends over at your house, I bet they’ll clean their room without you having to ask – as long as having a clean room elevates their social status and earns them the respect of their peers.

Why is your kid super disrespectful to you when their friends are around? Probably because they feel that they’ll have a higher social status if they can prove they don’t need or rely on their parents – they gain the position and respect of an adult.

Basically, kids are motivated by things that parents don't always understand, which can make communication... difficult. How can we bridge the gap between parents and kids?

1. Have high standards *and* high support

When deciding between correcting your kid or letting things slide, you have to realize that there’s a third option: you don’t have to be either a “tiger mom” or a super relaxed, “chill” parent.

“You can have high standards *and* high support” (17).

Expect great things from your kid while also ensuring they have the resources to do them.

Here’s an example used in *10 to 25*: say your kid wants to drop out of college because it’s too hard and they’re not getting good grades. If parents don’t realize that there’s a third option, they’ll often “either kick [their] kid out or lavish them with free housing. Then, because we get it only half-right, we miscommunicate with [our kids] preventing them from fulfilling their potential” (17).

Instead, you can get your kid a tutor (or online, AI-powered apps!) and support from someone who lives near the college (could likely require meeting new people and asking for help from you), while encouraging them to stay at school. Problem solve together – keep your standards high while giving them the support they need.

2. Respect and social status

As Yeager puts it: “Young people want status and respect from peers and mentors, earned by making meaningful contributions” (27-28).

This has two parts: one, respect your kid for their capabilities and values, and two, give them opportunities to become respected by their peers.

This requires a mindset shift from *you*. You must recognize that your child is someone worthy of respect and must be treated as such. Don’t talk down to them or assume that they don’t know anything; instead, talk to them as an equal and understand that their actions are backed by reason.

If you want them to improve their grades, instead of ordering them to study more or else, try something like “I know you are capable of doing great things – you’ve proven that by [insert something great they’ve done]. You can absolutely get better outcomes – and I will do anything I can to help you reach them.” Not only is this acknowledging their status and ability, but it’s also ensuring both high standards and high support.

And in regard to actually achieving these goals, “[y]oung people rise to meet the challenge because being respected is motivating” (7).

Now, what are the specific things you can do for your kids?

I think it starts with this simple idea: “Employing the science-based strategies in this book may take a little bit of thought, but it doesn’t have to take a lot of *time*” (7).

You will likely have to change the way you interact and speak with your kid, which will take effort, but not necessarily more time. This is the thing that will set you apart from most parents: too many don’t want to put in more effort, even if it doesn't take them more time to do.

My favorite part of the first chapter was the explanation of the anti-smoking campaign and why it didn’t work. The solution seemed laughably obvious: “have any of you ever asked a teenager why they smoked–like, what they got out of it?” (31).

Have you ever asked a teenager “why”?

The answer, of course, was no.

So many adults think that teenagers and adolescents are too incompetent to know the right way to do something or the best decision to make – but they aren’t. As I mentioned before, they just have different priorities. In the case of smoking, it made them feel like an adult – someone in charge of their own bodies, which in turn raised their social status and respect among their peers.

I promise: your kid isn’t stupid. In fact, “studies [showed] that adolescents could show all the hallmarks of a mature, adult brain–planning ahead, weighing multiple options, accurately conducting complex value calculations–when it was for social rewards, such as helping others or looking good in front of a peer” (43).

If your kid is doing something that doesn’t make sense to you, try asking them “why” or think about how this action could lead to a social reward. It will go a long way.

Secondly, make sure your kid knows that you will support them through anything and everything. Don’t assume they know.

Be explicit. The best shooting coach in the NBA talks about how much more players improve when he’s clear about his support. He says to them, “‘I’m with you for the ups, downs, and all-arounds. I won’t ditch you if it doesn’t work right away’” (13). Say something like this to your kid the next time they’re going through something hard. It might feel uncomfortable or weird, but you don’t know how much your kid needs to hear it.

Finally, when talking to your kid about important topics or asking them to change their actions, here are four guidelines you should follow to get the most ideal results:

“First: ask, don’t tell. This respects the young people by treating them as adultlike. Adults are asked, children are told.

Second: find ways to honor the young person’s status–for example, point out their competence and expertise–rather than simply appealing to your own authority.

Third: validate whatever negative experiences young people may have had. Treat their feelings as real and legitimate. Then look for a way forward.

Fourth: presume agency. Acknowledge that the young person can make up their own mind, and then make it clear that you are rooting for them to make the healthy and positive choice. Another part of presuming agency is pointing out how their actions can have broader consequences (e.g. “doing your part” to help others)” (49-50).

Young people aren’t as much of a mystery as people think.

And once you understand their motivations, you can dramatically improve your relationship and help them reach their potential.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Can AI Condense Two Years of Learning Into Six Weeks?](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-digital-self/202501/can-ai-condense-two-years-of-learning-into-six-weeks)

In a classroom in Nigeria, students used AI to accomplish *two years* of learning in just *six weeks*.

Absolutely remarkable.

This paragraph from the article truly displayed the incredible possibilities of AI apps in learning:

“Imagine a young girl, previously held back by a lack of resources, now learning to code and write essays in English. Imagine classrooms where [gender](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender) disparities shrink, as AI creates an egalitarian space for knowledge. One of the program’s most remarkable outcomes was its ability to benefit all students, not just the highest achievers. Girls, who initially lagged behind boys in performance, seemed to gain even more from the intervention, highlighting its potential to bridge gender gaps in learning. The pilot gave these students not just lessons but agency—a glimpse of futures once unimaginable. It’s the kind of change that feels like the first spark of a transformation destined to illuminate classrooms globally.”

2. [Severance](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/severance/umc.cmc.1srk2goyh2q2zdxcx605w8vtx?&app=tv&cid=wwa-us-kwgo-tvp-slid-&itscg=MC_20000&itsct=atvp_brand_omd&mttnsiteid=143238&mttnagencyid=a5e&mkwid=zxnj5jSX&mttncc=US&mttn3pid=Google%20AdWords&mttnsubplmnt=_adext_&mttnsubad=OUS2019927_1-728942674443-c&mttnsubkw=133111427260__zxnj5jSX_)

I binged the entirety of season one of *Severance* on Apple TV last weekend. Yeah, I’m not exactly proud of it, but I need to illustrate how gripping this show is. The first episode is weird and confusing, but once you reach the second, you’ll realize *that’s the whole point*. *Severance* is a fantastic show that questions your morality, takes you to the extremes, and makes you fall in love with two different versions of the same person.

The premise of the show is that a company (Lumon) has created a procedure called “Severance” that causes employees to have a “surgically divided memory between their work and personal lives.” The main character, Mark, doesn’t have the memories of him working at Lumon while at home, and while at work, Mark doesn’t have any personal memories. The story revolves around Mark and his co-workers as they try and uncover the secrets behind Severance and Lumon.

This leads to the questions: *What made these characters go to this extreme? What is Lumon doing to require Severance for employees? Will they ever get both sets of memories? Why is the main character so important? Why does the Severed floor seem off?*

So yes, it’s weird and confusing, but so incredibly interesting. Common Sense Media says the show is appropriate for kids 15+ and the worst part (that I can remember, at least) is cursing and attempted violence. I’d definitely recommend watching this show with your kid if you have the chance!

3. [How to connect with people](https://x.com/Aurrelio/status/1883885704670859683)

This post dives into the best way to interview someone (inspired by Joe Rogan), but I think most of the concepts apply to basic conversations – how to connect with someone, how to get someone to like you, etc.

Here’s the TL;DR

1. Lighten the mood

Open with a “genuine compliment about their work or presence.” Get them comfortable talking to you.

2. Find mutual interests

Start talking about a topic you’re interested in and try to find common ground with the other person – bond over the similarities.

3. Ask “why?”

Truly try to learn more about the other person – get them to talk about themselves in a deep way.

Here is a diagram from the original post:
