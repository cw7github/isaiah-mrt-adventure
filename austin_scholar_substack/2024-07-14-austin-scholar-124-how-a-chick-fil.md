### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: Proof that I’ve become a self-driven learner
2. How a Chick-fil-a lunch got a whole school to improve their test scores by an entire grade level
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

Since I’ve gotten back from my senior trip, I’ve spent a *ton* of time with my family – definitely annoying my sister with the number of hugs she’s received. I’m getting a lot more worried about not seeing them while I’m at college and have considered the best ways to kidnap my sister and hide her in my dorm room so I can hear her snarky remarks in person instead of over the phone (for legal reasons, this is a joke).

### Austin’s Anecdote: Proof that I’ve become a self-driven learner

Alpha crushes exams.

Seriously crushes exams.

Below is a graph comparing Alpha students to both Austin ISD, Eanes ISD (considered one of the best districts in Texas), and Texas as a whole.

Alpha students just blow everyone else out of the water.

How? Our kids care about exams.

For a lot of teens, it feels safer to not try than to try and fail. On TikTok after AP exam scores come out, there are thousands of videos of kids saying things like “me getting a 2 on AP Lit after writing the lyrics to All Too Well (10 minute version) for all of my essays.” It feels less embarrassing to purposely get a bad score than to risk one.

But the real goal of school should be to get kids to see themselves as good learners – people who can succeed if they try.

For example, this year, I took AP European History for literally no reason at all.

Like… seriously no reason.

Stanford doesn’t take AP Euro as any type of credit and I’d already gotten into Stanford so there was no need to try and impress them with my score anymore. In fact, I probably won’t even send them my final score.

I gained nothing at all for spending hours and hours studying for the exam and taking it – and even doing well enough to get a 5.

So why did I take it at all? Because it’s fun.

I’m confident enough in my academic abilities to know that I can succeed if I put in the effort and spending a few extra hours a week talking about Europe’s many wars and philosophies with my friends genuinely made me happy.

I’ve truly become a self-driven learner. No rewards are necessary for me to spend my time learning something new.

### How a Chick-fil-a lunch got a whole school to improve their test scores by an entire grade level

I guess the question then becomes: how does Alpha get kids (who often don’t see themselves as good students or have an intrinsic love of learning) to do well?

The answer’s simple: extrinsic rewards.

Alpha uses extrinsic rewards to motivate kids until they see themselves as good students – and eventually you can take the extrinsic reward away

But until students are ready to be self-driven, the extrinsic rewards can be very powerful.

Alpha did a great experiment a couple of months ago.

All of the students (K-8) took an end-of-year exam without an incentives – they were told that the exam was just to see how much they’d learned throughout the year. Unfortunately, the kids did worse than expected (Alpha has projections of how well the students should do based on the app work they completed over the year.)

The guides then brought all of the kids together and told them that if they retook the test and did as was expected, they could get Chick-Fil-A for lunch.

The kids retook the exam just two days later and, miraculously, collectively scored *an entire grade level higher*.

The only thing that changed was the promise of Chick-Fil-A.

What can you as a parent do, then, to support your kid?

Well, pretty much the same thing.

Too many parents get so caught up in obsessing over what the perfect extrinsic reward would be for their kid that they forget that a simple Chick-Fil-A dinner is often more than enough.

To set everything up, have your kid take [the IXL diagnostic](https://www.ixl.com/diagnostic?partner=google&campaign=71589568&adGroup=11359145728&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwy8i0BhAkEiwAdFaeGLH-g6C-R3Dh1tnqITRK2FhZjdPNepktoP_fV-rYpYFJe3PCNaGN_hoCM1gQAvD_BwE) for their grade level and have them spend 30 minutes per day after school working through all of the units they don’t know (for every week they do this, get them ice cream or something else small that they enjoy). Then, at the end of the year, tell your kid that if they reach the “mastered” level in their STAAR test (or equivalent score in other states) they get a nice Chick-Fil-A dinner or extra screen time for the summer (that would be a *huge* motivator for a lot of kids).

And soon enough, they’ll get used to doing well on exams and build up confidence in themselves. They’ll realize that when they actually try, they can succeed. Maybe then, they too will do an AP exam senior year for no reward other than their own satisfaction.

So, what does all of this mean?

A lot of nationwide testing results are probably low. Students likely know more than what is being reported because they don’t care about performing well when they are taking the test.

Motivation in students is a *huge* problem, but it seems that a little Chick-Fil-A can go a long way.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [Ender’s Game](https://www.amazon.com/Enders-Ender-Quintet-Orson-Scott/dp/0812550706)

To continue my sci-fi reading journey, *Ender’s Game* was recommended to me by one of my favorite Austin Scholar readers – and it did not disappoint. I absolutely loved reading about how the tiny ten-year-old Ender saved the world. His dry sarcasm made me laugh quite a bit and the plot twist actually had me screaming. I loved the thought experiments in this book – fighting with no gravity, empathy versus ruthlessness, and questioning what makes a leader all had me captivated.

2. [Unthinkable](https://www.netflix.com/title/70122330)

Speaking of thought experiments, the movie *Unthinkable* starring Samuel L. Jackson is one of the best. Now, this movie is EXTREMELY GORY and VIOLENT so I cannot in good conscience recommend it to watch with your kids. However, if you do, be prepared to question your morals. Ask yourself this: how far would you go to get information that would save lives? Also – after you finish the movie, look up the original ending and see if that changes your mind.

3. [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/)

I thought I was all done with online apps given that I’m headed to college, but my dad found one for college math (yay?!). Math Academy is completely rooted in learning science and essentially the perfect math app for Alpha. It has math content starting in 4th grade – and includes placement tests along with super detailed lessons and explanations. I’ll probably be taking the Calculus course to refresh before I start classes :)
