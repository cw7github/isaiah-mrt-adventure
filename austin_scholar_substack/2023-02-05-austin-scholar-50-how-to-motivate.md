### **Hey, y'all!**

A lot of kids get comfortable doing the bare minimum to get by. But to be great, you have to push and challenge yourself to do *more* than what's expected of you.

In the real world, you get real-life rewards for pushing your limits.

While your kids are still in school, you can simulate that by offering rewards yourself for great performance. This has been incredibly helpful for me in my own journey.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: The Alpha Rocketship
2. How to Motivate Your Teen to Push Their Limits
3. Scholar’s Sources: Three Awesome No-Downside Risks Your Kid Can Take

Y’all–my poetry won an award! A few months ago, I submitted some pieces to the Scholastic Awards, just because. I wasn’t really expecting anything from it. And I forgot all about it until this week, when I got an email from Scholastic telling me I won an award for my collection. The certificate is now hanging on our fridge.

This really reminded me that taking no-downside risks like that can actually pay off. And, it gave me some confidence to continue taking those risks–which, for now, means I'm going to be bolder about sending DMs to people I admire on Twitter.

Just take the chance. Do the cool thing. It might just pay off. (Check out Scholar’s Sources for some ideas on risks your kid can take.)

### Austin’s Anecdote: The Alpha Rocketship

My school, [Alpha](https://alphahigh.school/), recently implemented a new motivation system called the Rocketship.

The Rocketship is a special program for students who exceed standards in both academics (regular school subjects) and our Masterpieces (our individual 4-year graduation projects) standards.

The benefits of the Rocketship include…

* A Rocketship-only room at school to work in
* A mini-fridge and snacks
* $3,000 to invest in each person’s Masterpiece
* An incredible trip to Mexico to build a workshop to be distributed online called "how to have a 75% chance at getting into an Ivy League."

Yeah, there are some pretty extraordinary rewards.

But, there's a catch.

To stay in the Rocketship, each student must achieve a challenging, almost impossible goal every session (a six-week period of school, which we use instead of semesters).

For example, by February 24th, I need to reach 10,000 Twitter followers and my two best friends need to reach 25,000 TikTok followers. (The purpose of these goals is to dramatically increase our real-world credibility and reach in our fields.)

But really, these goals are no joke and require an insane amount of hard work and dedication.

For the past month, I’ve been at school until 8:00 pm, posting on Twitter and DM-ing experts and doing all the things I need to do, but I’m still off-pace.

At my current trajectory, I’m not going to be in the Rocketship next session. But you know what? I want to stay.

I *want* to keep my mini-fridge. I *want* to see what new privileges the Rocketship will have next session. And, I *really want* to be a part of this amazing group of other motivated students.

So to reach my goal, I’m going to put in even more effort. I’ll work that extra hour every night and ask more people to retweet my content and ask for help. (Seriously–if any of y’all could support my Twitter journey, I would be so grateful.)

And the rest of my classmates who didn’t get into the Rocketship this session are also working harder than ever to reach their goals, so they get invited into the Rocketship next session. They understand the high standards and are working toward them, something they didn’t care about before.

The Rocketship program is a fantastic example of how rewarding kids for their hard work and high standards can lead to really cool outcomes.

It motivates students to put in the effort to reach their goals and be the best version of themselves. Everyone’s putting in the work to get a chance to be in the Rocketship.

And I think that might say something about how to motivate kids.

### How to Motivate Your Teen to Push Their Limits

Y’all have probably heard that “teenagers don’t have high standards,” or that “teenagers don’t work hard.” When true, both of these things can be absolutely detrimental in today’s ultra-competitive, AI-driven world.

Why? Well, the competition is tougher than ever. So many people are vying for the same opportunities–and it’s crucial to stand out among the crowd.

High standards will set your kid up for a path of success–one where they’re always thinking about improving a little bit every day.

But I’ll admit: getting teenagers to actually have these high standards for themselves can be pretty challenging.

Most of them have lived their lives by the philosophy of doing the bare minimum to get where they need to go–but that's the path to mediocrity, not success.

So, how do you motivate kids to put in the work and have high standards for themselves?

The answer is a high-input, high-output reward system.

Basically: if your kid puts in a ton of consistent, hard work, they get a really cool, useful reward. If they stop putting in the work, the reward goes away.

I talked about this is [Austin Scholar #41: Yes, You Should Bribe Your Teen](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-41-yes-you-should), where I advocated for setting a big reward for an outsized goal. But what about the everyday? It isn’t always “one big goal” and there isn’t always a Taylor Swift concert.

The answer is to create a reward system that relies on consistency and excellence.

Just like the Rocketship requires consistent work for every six-week period, you can create a process that incentivizes your teen to meet specific goals and standards over a period of time in order to receive some reward during the next period. For example, if your kid gets all A’s on their assignments during a 2-week period, they can have unlimited screen time the next 2-week period.

The cool thing about this system is that if your teen doesn’t put in the work and doesn’t get the reward for one session, they can work towards it again the next. There’s no true end to the motivation. If the reward itself needs to change, that’s okay, too.

This system also encourages teens to have a growth mindset, because they’re constantly working to improve their work and daily life. It instills a strong work ethic and discipline in them, preparing them for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the competitive world.

As time goes on, this hard work will become the norm. Your kid will expect themselves to accomplish these challenging goals every day, unknowingly raising their baseline for success and productivity.

And of course–this doesn’t only apply to academics.

For example, I, of course, set high expectations for my grades and academic understanding. But, I spend twice as much time every day working on Austin Scholar. My biggest goals are writing and audience building–and that’s my Rocketship goal.

I haven’t yet learned how to have the constant high standards needed to achieve all of my Austin Scholar aspirations, so the external motivation from the Rocketship is teaching me how hard I need to work and what I need to do to get there.

Before, I would post three times a week to meet the distribution requirements.

Now, I’m posting three times a day.

The Rocketship has motivated me to drastically change my daily habits and standards around my goals.

I want to put in the work to keep my reward, and that's the beauty of these systems–they help keep students focused.

### Scholar’s Sources: Three Great No-Downside Risks Your Kid Can Take

Here are three great no-downside risks your kid can take (Who knows? Something awesome might come from them):

1. [The Scholastic Art and Writing Awards](https://www.artandwriting.org/)

This is the risk that paid off for me. If your kid is a writer or an artist, consider having them submit their work here.

2. [The Conrad Challenge](https://www.conradchallenge.org/conrad-challenge)

The aspiring entrepreneurs will love this one. The 2022-23 deadline has already passed, but there’s a ton of prep that could be done for next year. In small teams, they’ll go through the entrepreneurial process and design something that solves an important problem.

3. [The Breakthrough Junior Challenge](https://breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org/)

If you have a STEM kid, have them check out this challenge. They’ll make a short video explaining a complex concept in an engaging way.
