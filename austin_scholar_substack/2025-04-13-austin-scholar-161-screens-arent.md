### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: The skills I used to crush sorority recruitment
2. Screens aren’t just the problem; they’re the solution
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

I’m happy to announce that I am officially a Pi Phi! Last weekend’s sorority recruitment was a crazy, exciting, exhausting experience. I’m an introvert, so three straight days of nonstop talking to tons of different girls does not sound like my idea of a perfect weekend. However, I truly had so much fun getting to both meet new girls and see girls that I hadn’t seen since orientation week. *But why did I want to Rush in the first place?* you might be wondering.

The best part of my Stanford experience so far has been connecting with all of the girls on my dorm floor. It’s such a beautiful community and I would love to build another one for the rest of my time at Stanford – and a sorority seems like the perfect place to do that. I’ll be keeping y’all updated on how that goes, but I’m super excited to be a Pi Phi angel so far!

### Austin’s Anecdote: The skills I used to crush sorority recruitment

1. How to talk to people

I might be a naturally shy person and frequently not know what to say in new social situations, but I *showed up* last weekend. I found every single way I could connect with the girl I was talking to (where we’re from, if we both have a sister, what classes we’re taking, etc.) and explained how my interests (education, fostering sisterhood, etc.) could help the sororities on their missions.

Here are two newsletters where I outline how to have great conversations and make friends (all of these concepts are applicable to any non-sorority recruitment scenario as well):

[Austin Scholar #91: How to have great conversations over the holidays](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-91-how-to-have-great)

2. Pitching

Pitching yourself is critical to sorority recruitment. Despite not being a product, you have to explain and prove to sororities why they want you. During the longer conversations I had with the girls, I used mostly steps three and five of Elon Musk’s pitching structure: painting the promised land and winning them over with evidence. Essentially, I explained how I would contribute to the ideal sorority experience and what I’ve already done to prove I can.

Here’s my favorite newsletter on pitching:

3. Grit

Although Rush isn’t the typical “gritty” experience you might think of, grit is definitely an essential skill to get through this process (particularly for introverts like me). After the first day of talking and screaming for six hours straight, I completely lost my voice – a true nightmare for any girl rushing. But despite the true pain and scratchiness that came from using my voice, I did have to push through for the next two days. And I was honestly just tired – every day was super exhausting. But you have to pretend that you’re the most energized and happy you’ve ever been in your life. You’ve just gotta have grit and push through.

Here are two newsletters I’ve written about grit:

### Screens aren’t just the problem; they’re the solution

The pandemic was not the start of our country’s educational problems.

In reality, our education system has been failing students for a while now, and standardized test scores have been dropping for twenty years. And it doesn’t only affect students.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s_Gt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3a4e975-d2b2-49f8-8765-b5d5ec6ad432_1426x782.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s_Gt!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3a4e975-d2b2-49f8-8765-b5d5ec6ad432_1426x782.png)

The data paints an alarming picture of adult learning capabilities and ability to understand the world around them. At the national average skill levels in numeracy, literacy, and adaptive problem solving, adults struggle with fundamental skills that should be the bedrock of critical thinking:

To begin with numeracy, most adults cannot:

* Perform complex calculations with whole numbers, decimals, and percentages
* Determine missing values in data sets
* Apply proportional reasoning
* Critically evaluate mathematical conclusions

Onto literacy, most adults cannot:

* Understand and interpret larger chunks of text.
* Perform multi-step operations to find and create answers.
* Identify, interpret, or evaluate multiple pieces of information.
* Use reasoning and inference at different levels.

And finally, most adults experience:

* Difficulty generating mental models for complex problems
* Challenges in distinguishing relevant from irrelevant information
* Struggles with comprehensive problem-solving strategies

Basically, the education system has failed to teach students how to think critically, form their own opinions, and evaluate or even understand facts.

I can across a [study](https://www.ft.com/content/a8016c64-63b7-458b-a371-e0e1c54a13fc) earlier this week from a [post](https://x.com/JonHaidt/status/1900546509516541975) by Jonathan Haidt (who wrote [The Anxious Generation](https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036), a book that outlines how phone usage is contributing to teen mental illness), so the comments under the post predictably all blamed phones for the decline in students’ test scores and abilities to learn new things.

But while I do believe devices have had an impact on these characteristics, they are not the only reason for the decline in educational standards and abilities throughout this country, and just taking away a child’s cell phone will not fix the problem. We need to fix the system.

If you’ve been around for a while, you already know what I’m going to say.

The two biggest problems with the traditional educational model is the lack of personalized education and the absence of mastery-based learning.

**Personalized education**

The traditional educational system often falls short in providing personalized education, instead relying on a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to cater to individual learning needs. This rigid framework ignores the unique cognitive load and knowledge levels of each student, which can lead to a significant disparity in learning outcomes.

Every student learns at their own pace and has distinct strengths and weaknesses, and a standardized approach leaves some students struggling to keep up while others find the material too easy. As a result, students don’t receive the tailored support and challenges they need to reach their full potential, leading to a lack of engagement and motivation – and then a severe lack of knowledge.

**Mastery-based learning**

Students are often allowed to progress through the curriculum without demonstrating a true comprehension of the material, with little emphasis placed on deep understanding and skill mastery. This can lead to a superficial understanding of the subject matter, where students may be able to recall facts and formulas but lack the ability to apply them in a meaningful way.

Mastery learning, on the other hand, focuses on ensuring that students have a thorough grasp of the material before moving on to more advanced topics. This approach not only helps to build a strong foundation but also fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of the subject matter. By neglecting to prioritize mastery learning, the educational system may be doing a disservice to students, who may be left unprepared for the challenges of the real world.

Without mastery-based learning, you end up with adults who don’t understand percentages well enough to calculate a 20% tip after a meal.

If you want to set your kid up for success and make sure that they do not end up as the average adult would, check out [this newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-153-how-alpha-students) where I outline exactly how students learn 2.5x more than public school students – and in just two hours every day. And you know what? They use screens and AI to do it.

New technology allows every single student to have a personalized tutor and learning plan in their back pocket, so they’re never confused or bored. Because of this personalization, they’re able to learn more content and more efficiently, so they free up so much time to both just be kids and learn life skills like public speaking, pitching, and grit that can set them up for success in their future (even if that success is sorority recruitment).

So yes, phones and screens might be part of the problem that plagues our educational system, but that’s nowhere near the full story. There are a multitude of systematic problems with traditional education and technology plays a massive role in the solution.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [How big data is changing football](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03698-1)

I’m incredibly lucky to be taking an IntroSem (introductory seminar) this quarter on sports analytics, and in our first class, we got to talk to the head coach of the women’s soccer team at Stanford, Paul Ratcliffe! Even cooler – he brought [Kelley O’Hara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelley_O%27Hara), a legend in women’s soccer, with him (O’Hara said that he was one of the best coaches she’d ever worked with). They spent an hour and a half walking us through all of the different ways they use analytics to win games – from analyzing the other team to each individual player’s physical performance, to reviewing the game film (if you want to hear what all-star baseball player J.D. Martinez has to say about watching game film, check out [this newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-36-the-four-skills)). As fascinating as it all was, one important theme stuck out to me – how to view the game as an art instead of something scientific or something to be analyzed. Both O’Hara and Ratcliffe explained how to truly be a winner, you have to have a gut instinct on how to play.

I liked what they were saying, but I couldn’t fully grasp it because I don’t really know what half of the words they were saying about making game-time decisions meant (I don’t know anything about soccer). So, I brought it back to something I do know: baseball. Here’s a [video](https://x.com/BBGreatMoments/status/1908542707296764333) of Barry Bonds breaking down an at-bat. While he’s obviously mastered the technical aspects of the game, Bonds has this instinct about what’s going to be thrown next – and that’s what makes him successful.

I think it goes back to this notion that you have to be an expert in the foundational skills in order to create, innovate, or have insights. O’Hara and Bonds both know their sports inside and out, so they know when it’s time for them to break the rules, push a little harder, or just take a step back. Expertise is the groundwork for greatness, and O’Hara and Bonds are just two more examples who prove it.

(Ratcliffe said something to the effect of, *when the good get tired, the great start playing*, and I’ve been thinking about it since. I get why he’s a coach.)

2. [Don’t blindly listen to the news about AI in education – try thinking more deeply](https://thehill.com/opinion/education/5232309-public-education-artificial-intelligence/)

I recently came across an article titled “Think our education system is bad now? Wait ’til AI takes over” – and I’m sad to report that so many people are reading the most surface-level discussion of AI’s potential impact on education. Instead of discussing how AI can allow students to learn at unprecedented levels and create personalized learning plans for each student, the article just explains how you can cheat with AI. Which I won’t lie, is true, but doesn’t cover the massive ability of AI to help students learn more and faster. So I encourage you to think about the true potential of using AI in education beyond whatever titles you see online. It definitely goes a lot deeper than you might be expecting.
