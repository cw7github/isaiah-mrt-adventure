### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. How to design epic summer plans (and why you should)
2. Austin’s Anecdote: My summer plans (and how they relate to my long-term goals)
3. Scholar’s Sources: My favorite online summer courses for summer studying

It’s getting to the end of the school year, and I’ve been pretty stressed as I try to tie up loose ends. It’s absolutely crazy that my junior year is almost over–and that I just watched one of my very best friends (that I’ve known for the last seven years) graduate high school this week. I’m growing up. Things are changing. And it’s scary. And since it's almost summer, I'm going to be writing about summer plans this week. If you've been around for a while, you'll know this is one of my favorite topics.

### How to design epic summer plans (and why you should)

I used to be terrible at making [summer plans](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-22-how-to-help-your). Over the years, I’ve done some super interesting things. Most recently, last summer, I went to [Oxford for two weeks](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-26-three-ways-to-get) for a writing program. That program–and summertime in general–gave me the chance to explore interests that I don’t have time for in during school.

I’ll tell you about my summer plans for this year in a bit, but first: I’m a huge advocate of everyone making the most out of their summers, and I’m going to tell you how I’d do it.

Summer is the most valuable part of a kid’s year–but most of us aren’t using it properly.

If you want to help your kid create the best summer plan possible (even if it’s last minute), follow the three F’s: family, fun, and future.

First up: family.

[90% of the time](https://www.coursenvy.com/post/90-percent-of-the-time-you-spend-with-your-parents-is-over) a kid spends with their parents is over by the time they leave for college. That’s a scary statistic. But, summer is the perfect time to strengthen your relationship with your kid and spend as much time with them as you can.

Find small activities that you can do with your kid throughout the summer–whether it’s watching a show (or a sports team!) together or trying out fun “summer” recipes. Spend time doing little things that they’ll remember for the rest of their life.

If possible, taking a family vacation is another great way to foster your connection and have experiences you won’t forget. Even better, try to be adventurous on vacation and do things that–as a family–you normally wouldn’t. Going to the beach and swimming with sharks or learning to scuba dive are such memorable experiences for the family.

Next: fun.

Of course, it’s super important for kids to have fun with their summer. It’s a chance for them to enjoy their childhood and explore who they are without the distractions of school occupying their time. Make sure your kid takes the time to experiment with new hobbies and try new things. There aren’t any expectations when school is out, so make sure your kid takes advantage of the freedom.

Some example “new” activities could include…

* Rock climbing
* Baking cupcakes
* Playing an instrument

These new hobbies can be anything your kid finds interesting. They don't have to be clearly relevant to their academic or professional goals–your kid can just choose a new skill or habit they want to learn, just for fun.

And lastly (and most importantly for high schoolers!): future.

Summer is the time for kids to work towards the future they dream of. They don’t have to worry about academics, so instead they can spend their time developing their passion and doing cool things to help prepare them for their future.

Encourage them to take a for-credit college course, start a YouTube channel or podcast, write a research paper, host a TedX Youth conference, or reach out to someone they admire. There are so many opportunities for your kid to start establishing who they are and build up their resume. If you want personalized recommendations as to what your kid could do this summer, please reach out to me! I’d love to help.

### Austin’s Anecdote: My summer plans (and how they relate to my long-term goals)

So, taking all of that into account, here is my last-minute–as always–summer plan (using the three F’s):

**Family**

The week after school gets out, my dad and I are going to Dallas, Texas to watch Rangers games. We are both huge baseball fans, so spending a few days together watching the Rangers play is such a nice way to start off my summer :)

And at the end of July, my whole family is going to the beach to have some quality relaxation time. We almost always go on beach trips with another family, so my sister and I will spend the day with our friends looking for conch shells and swimming in the ocean, before all of us come together for family dinners. My family doesn’t generally do “family dinners” because our schedules don’t match up, but we always eat together on vacation, which makes it extra special.

**Fun**

The beach trip itself is more than enough to cover the “fun” aspect of my summer, but I also plan to spend more time reading “for fun” books and going down YouTube rabbit holes.

During the school year, I never seem to have time to just read for the sake of reading, which is an absolute travesty. I have made plans to go to BookPeople (my favorite bookstore) multiple times per month to judge books by their covers and find my new favorite book.

And while I’m studying during the school year by watching YouTube videos on my courses, I always see some super cool video on the sidebar that I really want to watch, but can’t because, you know, studying. But, I’ll have no such restrictions over the summer and will make the most of my YouTube recommendations.

**Future**

Because I’m a rising senior (how absolutely terrifying), working towards my future is the biggest part of my summer.

First off, I have to start writing my Common App essay and working on my applications in general. The UCAS (the UK’s version of the Common App), is already open. I could literally apply to a college right now. Since I want to apply to UK schools, I should probably get to work on that.

Of course, I’ll be writing my newsletter each week and working to grow [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/AustinScholar) from 6,000 to 10,000 followers. I will also be doing the Yale Summer Session for “Readings in American Literature” to get college credit and display my commitment and love for English literature and reading, which is one of the most important things for me to show to colleges.

Finally, I’m spending three weeks in Budapest putting together a program to help Ukrainian refugee kids kickstart their education using a lot of the lessons I teach in my newsletter: harnessing educational apps and learning online.

Feeling like I’m growing up is scary, but I feel proud of what I’m working on.

### Scholar’s Sources: My favorite online summer courses for summer studying

It can seem super daunting to navigate finding interesting online courses for your kid to do this summer, so here are a few of my favorites:

[Outlier](https://www.outlier.org/): While it’s not specifically designed for high school students, Outlier has fantastic virtual for-credit educational courses with asynchronous work and an online community. I loved both the Calculus and Statistics courses I took, so I can’t recommend it enough.

[Masterclass](https://www.masterclass.com/): Again, Masterclass isn’t specifically designed for high school students, but each asynchronous course seems incredibly engaging and exciting for any age. A few years ago, I did the Anna Wintour course on leadership and can honestly say I’ve learned so much. The best thing about Masterclass is that it supports any passion or interest your kid might have, so there will definitely be a class for them.

[Oxford Scholastica Academy](https://www.oxfordscholastica.com/online-summer-school/courses/?gclid=CjwKCAjw2rmWBhB4EiwAiJ0mtamOUVVL1js3uxiKkD6zAfTg_sRb9S_batEwABY0E-webng_qa0dWxoC5GAQAvD_BwE): Oxford Scholastica Academy is another cool online course program. It offers kids the opportunity to join a class with students from around the world and master a subject through discussion, research, and debates.

Finally, if you’re looking for a pre-college program (some of them are for-credit!), check out [this website](https://www.c2educate.com/15-top-summer-programs-for-high-school-students-still-accepting-applications/). It has a full list of programs that are still currently accepting applications. I highly recommend checking some of these out.
