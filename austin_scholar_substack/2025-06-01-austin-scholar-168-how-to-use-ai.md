### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: A declassified high school survival guide
2. How to use AI in your kid's summer (Part 2)

Before we get started this week, I just want to say congrats to Alpha High’s 2025 graduating class!! I couldn’t be more proud of these graduates (many of whom are my close friends). They’ve put in so much work both on their own projects and on improving the Alpha system and making it the best school in the country. I’m so proud of the amazing people I get to call my fellow alumni.

In other news, I’m now studying for finals! I have both a math and a CS exam, as well as presentations in German and my sports analytics class. I’m super excited to do a deep-dive newsletter soon on my Stanford classes (particularly CS), with both my thoughts on the classes themselves and how Alpha prepared me to succeed in these classes, so stay tuned :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: A declassified high school survival guide

This week’s anecdote is written by an *extremely* special guest: the valedictorian of this year’s graduating class of Alpha High! I’ll just let her introduce herself:

*Hi y'all! I’m Clara Aboel-Nil and I just graduated from Alpha High. During my four years at Alpha I have worked on many projects.*

*Some highlights being: I developed an Al health coach based on users' genetics, launched a biotech newsletter (though I'll admit, The Austin Scholar had me beat there), and created TeachTap-an Al-powered app using TikTok-style videos to help students prep for APs and the SAT. TeachTap now has over 120,000 users, which I'm super proud of.*

*Content creation has been my most recent pursuit, and I’ve been working on it in a couple different ways.*

*On TikTok, I run @acebot.ai, where I teach math in online “[brain rot](https://corp.oup.com/news/brain-rot-named-oxford-word-of-the-year-2024/)" to over 60,000 followers. On YouTube, my channel @hush\_celebs racks up over 7 million views per month on shorts about celebrity news. And I've just launched a new YouTube channel, @Clara\_Nil, where I share vlogs and personal stories.*

*I’m always looking for new people to meet and connections to make so if any of what I said interests you, feel free to reach out!*

I wanted to celebrate Clara and her accomplishments and include excerpts from her graduation speech (which made my mom cry) that perfectly encapsulated this class’ journey at Alpha. Here’s what she said:

Welcome to Clara’s declassified high school survival guide: 4 steps to surviving at the craziest school in the world.

Step 1) Just do it.

I have a confession: My freshman year, I was a chronic procrastinator. And when I was taking APs, working on a Masterpiece (an extremely ambitious, seemingly-impossible four-year project), and making new friends, one brutal truth hit me hard: you have to do the work.

I signed up for AP Bio, thinking I had science in the bag. Spoiler alert: I didn't. I wasn't practicing the tough stuff, and sometimes I wasn’t practicing at all.

And then, in the sweltering heat of June, College Board hit me with a soul-crushing 4. Not academically catastrophic. But humbling. Because I didn’t fail the test – I failed to prepare.

That’s when I learned the first rule of survival: just do it. Not when it's convenient, not just when inspiration strikes, but every day. Do Olympians wait until the Olympics to train? No. They train every day of their lives so that when the time finally comes, all they have to do is show up.

Step 2) BYOB (but not in the way you’re thinking).

When you are picking a masterpiece, one of our fundamental principles is being an expert. To be an expert, you have to read the good, the bad, and the bewildering. And then? You take a stand. You don’t just need ideas – you need conviction.

When you’re at a school where arguments are blood sport and every lunch table feels like being interrogated, you'd better believe in your thesis. Because someone will challenge it – and probably cite three sources while they do it. So, BYOB. Or, bring your own backbone.

Make sure you truly believe in your Masterpiece project and are willing to argue for it, because *if you don’t believe in yourself, then how do you expect the rest of the world to?* But backbone isn’t enough when life throws you a curveball, which leads me to step three.

Step 3) Adapt or perish.

You’ve heard it before, “survival of the fittest,” but here’s something Darwin didn’t tell you. The fittest aren’t the strongest, they’re the most adaptable. And when you’re at a school of entrepreneurial Olympians, your brain better be training every day. Maybe you get ghosted on the Slack channel.

Maybe you discover negative XP on Math Academy for the first time. Maybe, just maybe, the wifi goes out for the third time in one day. Don’t panic. Pivot. The people who succeed aren’t the ones who never fail. They’re the ones who fall down seven times and get up eight. Be the one who doesn’t waste time wondering “why me?” but asks “what’s next?”

And finally, step 4) Savor the summit.

You walked up the mountain. You went through all four years, took those CBEs, retook those CBEs, got the credits, and are finally ready to walk across the stage. But you can’t appreciate the view from the top without appreciating what it took to get there. I couldn’t have asked for a better group of brilliant friends and mentors to call my family, and even though I’ll physically be in Boston, home is where the heart is. And I say Alpha will always be a home for me. So take a second, look around, appreciate your fellow climbers, and then set your sights back on the top.

So that's it – Clara’s declassified high school survival guide. With these four foolproof steps, I can guarantee that you will successfully make it through all four years at Alpha.

Because surviving Alpha High wasn’t about being the smartest in the room. It was about showing up when it was hard. Standing your ground when it would’ve been easier to fold. Learning to bend without breaking. And remembering to pause long enough to see the beauty in the chaos.

And if all else fails, ask ChatGPT.

### How to use AI in your kid's summer (Part 2)

I got great feedback on [last week’s newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-167-how-to-use-ai) and had a lot of parents asking me for additional AI summer project ideas, so that’s what I’m going to talk about again today!

I have a *ton* more ideas for using AI this summer. Whether your kids are into athletics, gaming, programming, music, cooking, sports, storytelling, or pretty much anything else, there should be ideas here for everyone. You can use these ideas outright, or modify them to fit your kids’ specific interests!

One of my current favorites: if your kid plays a sport, you can have them record videos of themselves completing certain skills and ask an AI to compare their skill to a professional’s performance. For example, I could record a video of myself doing a sit spin (a figure skating move!) and compare it to Alysa Liu’s sit spins. Then I could ask the AI to give me a step-by-step training plan to improve my skill.

If your kid is interested in gaming or game building, I’d recommend downloading Pycharm (a python coding terminal – I talked about it in last week’s newsletter too!). Once they have it installed, they can create a *ton* of stuff using an outside AI tool. I would recommend prompting it with something like:

*“I want to create a [breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) game in Python. Please write the code to do so and explain every step and what each function does. I am an extremely beginner coder, so please break down every single part.”*

Claude 3.7 has given me the best results with coding, so I’d recommend using that AI. However, if you come across an error, just copy and paste that into the AI and ask it how to fix the error and explain why and how it happened. You can do this with pretty much any basic game or coding activity. For more inspiration, you can check out this [list](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/cs106a/assignments/index.html) of coding activities in Stanford’s introductory Python class (the one I’m in!) or this [list](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-projects-for-beginners/) of beginner Python activities.

For slightly more advanced or older students, I think the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) tool is amazing. You have to import a few things for it to start working, but you can either watch the tutorial or ask Gemini to explain it to you. Colab essentially helps you with data analysis, so there are so many cool project ideas you can use it for. If you find an interesting data set (e.g. Los Angeles Dodgers pitching data through 2023, March Madness game information, avocado prices) and use the writing or commenting tool to explain what you want to do (e.g. what pitch is the most popular on a 3-2 count, how many Cinderella teams have won March Madness, different regions v. avocado prices), Gemini will auto-fill the code to complete this task. It’s not always 100% correct, but it can get you to the answer (even if you have to delete or change a few things).

For younger kids, they can use the drag-and-drop Tableau capabilities to create fun, vibrant visualizations for data analysis instead. They can also create their own rudimentary data set to play with (which I think could be really fun). For example, they can count the number of times they hear you say the word “like” in 24 hours or track the amount of sleep they get each night compared to how much TV they watched that day. Super fun while introducing them to the world of data collection and analysis.

Another fun project kids can do is use [SUNO](https://suno.com/) to write a song, then create a music video for it. They can either film it themselves and use an [AI editing tool](https://zapier.com/blog/best-ai-video-generator/) to bring it to life, or they can use OpenAI’s Sora or Google’s Veo 3 to generate clips for their music video and stitch them together. I always loved making music videos as a kid (and I just watched one recently that my sister and her best friend made six years ago) and think that this is a really fun and creative project.

For the culinary curious: your kid could ask ChatGPT for a mystery recipe to teach your kid how to cook. You could say something like this:

*“I'm eight years old and I want to learn how to cook, but in a super fun way. Please come up with a mystery recipe that will show me basic cooking skills, but that I won't know what I'm making. Please make the final product something unique, colorful, yet tasty. Please include the necessary ingredients (the more basic the better) and super clear instructions, but don't tell me what I'm making.”*

About 50% of the times I tried this, it said what the result was at the very end, so make sure your kid doesn’t read ahead. You can also customize the prompt based on the ingredients you have. Cooking is a great way for kids to learn how to follow instructions well, along with it being a great life skill in general.

If your kid is a big sports fan, they can ask ChatGPT to help predict the scores of a game. For my sports analytics class, we went to a Giants baseball game and had to predict the score, number of hits, pitch count, and maximum pitch speed at the end of each inning. We gave ChatGPT the information on the batters and pitchers to start, then asked for the prediction. As the game went on, we updated ChatGPT with the results and asked for additional predictions at the end of each inning based on who was up next in the lineup. Each time, we asked ChatGPT for the reasoning behind the predictions. This can be a super fun way to watch a sports game and connect with your kid. After a few innings (or a few predictions in whatever sport y’all watch), have your kid try and predict on their own. (BTW, my team won for best predictions.)

Finally, one thing I always loved doing as a kid was acting out stories in the pool (playing mermaids), in my friend’s backyard (playing adventurers), or even just around our apartment (playing fantasy characters fighting our favorite villains). You can have your kid give ChatGPT a photo of their backyard, the park, or their room along with the name of their favorite TV show or book (H2O Just Add Water, Harry Potter, Barbie: A Fairy Secret, The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel, and The Sisters Grimm were a few of the ones my friends and I used) and ask it to use those stories and their current surroundings to create a story for them to act out.

AI can give your kid inspiration and a starting point, but I believe using it is also a massive opportunity for them to be creative, have fun, and just be kids.

All of these activities and projects are based on things that I’ve done and enjoyed, both as a young kid and just weeks ago, so I think these projects really encapsulate all ages and interests. If you have any questions or want a more personalized project for your kid, please reach out and let me know.
