### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: Turning Equation-Based Writing Into a Course?
2. Three Writing Equations Your Kid Can Use (To Write a College Admissions Essay, a Text, and Win a Negotiation)
3. Scholar’s Sources: The World’s Coolest College Essay Writing Workshop

So… I got my driver’s license this week! After months of learning to drive (thanks, mom!) and hours of anxiety at the DPS, I officially became a driver. For some reason, I really felt sixteen years old yesterday, driving my sister and her best friend to pick up dinner and singing Taylor Swift songs in the car while I waited for them.

I also just want to thank my mom for all the time she and I spent freaking out as I accidentally reversed when I meant to go forward and stealing traffic cones to practice parallel parking. I’m so grateful. :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: Turning Equation-Based Writing Into a Course?

I got so much really great feedback from [last week’s newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/math-is-an-art-writing-is-a-science), specifically on the part that I’m going to call “Equation-Based Writing.”

Apparently, there are a lot of STEM boys (and their parents) who love the concept of improving their writing by looking at it like an equation. Who knew?

Because of the interest, I thought I’d write about this idea some more–and the writing sparked an entrepreneurial idea.

As you know, I’ve been working with [David Perell](https://perell.com/), teaching high schoolers to write on the internet through [an online course](https://writeofpassage.school/). And one of my friends (who's about to close on a $300,000 funding deal for his bike park) is the OG STEM boy at Alpha and used to beat me on math tests in third grade, but absolutely hates writing.

I've been surrounded by inspiration.

All of that, combined with the interest in Equation-Based Writing, created an idea for an online course: teaching STEM boys how to write by framing writing as an equation. I'm still in the early ideation phases, but I'm imagining a cohort-based course where math kids enter thinking writing sucks and come out at the end feeling adept at equation-based writing.

Because let's be real–a math whiz who can also communicate ideas clearly has a dangerous skillset.

If y’all have a kid who would be interested (or just generally think this is a good idea), please reach out to me! I’d love to brainstorm more. (I might start a Substack Chat soon, too.) And if you think this is an absolutely terrible idea, also reach out–I’d love feedback.

### Three Writing Equations Your Kid Can Use (To Write a College Admissions Essay, a Text, and Win a Negotiation)

For a sneak peek of the types of content I would teach, here are the equations your kid can use to write a college essay, a text to a significant other, and a pitch to convince you (their parents!) of something:

1. **The College Essay**

The college essay is the scariest, most life-changing piece of writing in any high schooler’s career. There’s just so much uncertainty surrounding this essay–but I’ve tried to simplify the entire process into one formula. I got the ⅓ estimates from [CollegeEssayGuy](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/how-to-write-a-college-essay) and the rest from my own research:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4gbz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F723099b5-0839-43f5-becd-d2c769d563da_930x140.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4gbz!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F723099b5-0839-43f5-becd-d2c769d563da_930x140.png)

To start off, your essay should support, if not demonstrate, to admissions officers how you’re the [best in the world at something](https://blog.prepscholar.com/how-to-get-into-harvard-and-the-ivy-league-by-a-harvard-alum)–or however close you can get. And it’s critical the essay has a coherent train of thought and is written in a unique, memorable way.

The breakdown of the content of the essay should be ⅓ challenges faced and their impact on you, ⅓ what you did to work through them, and ⅓ what you’ve learned.

Take the admissions officer on a journey through your growth.

Of course, there’s so much more to get into with college essays, but this equation will give your kids the formula to build the rest upon.

2. **The Text**

I don’t know how many of you have seen the [South Park episode](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/new-south-park-episode-written-ai/) where the boys use ChatGPT to reply to their girlfriends’ emotional texts. If you missed it, the premise is that the boys use ChatGPT to write reponses to their girlfriends (so they don’t have to)–but later get caught when the girls try to continue a conversation the boys can’t rememeber having.

Instead of using ChatGPT when their girlfriends confided in them, the South Park guys (and your kids!) could’ve used this formula:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NO1p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e36d3cc-429a-4c97-90f8-b9a8d004cda8_752x114.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NO1p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e36d3cc-429a-4c97-90f8-b9a8d004cda8_752x114.png)

You’ll want to start off the text by showing that you understand that your partner is going through a hard time. Validation goes a very long way.

Then, throw in an affectionate word like “admire” or “adore” to remind your partner of your feelings.

Next comes a “strength trait,” where you begin to encourage them. Say something  like “You have such a strong soul. I know you can work through this.” Anything where you describe their positive traits that will help them work through the situation.

After that, make sure you say that “I will support you” or that “I’m here for you”, which reinforces that you are someone they can lean on.

And finally, if you want, end the text with an inside joke or photo to lighten the mood and make your significant other smile.

As long as you keep a theme of love throughout the text, your partner will be both impressed and grateful.

3. **The Pitch**

Something I’ve learned in the past 16 years is that parents *love* slide decks. If I want to convince my parents to let me have a certain privilege or to buy me some special gift, the chance of them agreeing with me goes up dramatically if I have a slide deck and a prepared speech.

But what do those speeches include? Well, here’s the fool-proof formula your kid can use to help you understand their point of view (warning before you share with your kid, though: this really does work):

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!37rA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6fe3ad4-cd3a-4ea9-b0e8-51aeb8245fdd_1060x148.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!37rA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6fe3ad4-cd3a-4ea9-b0e8-51aeb8245fdd_1060x148.png)

To break it down further, you start with an acknowledgement of your parents’ side to show that you are thinking critically about the situation. (Ex. I understand your concerns regarding…)

Then, bring out the research you’ve done and credibility you have to prove your point. This will show that you’ve put time and effort into this discussion and have some data to back up your point.

Next, give your parents the “why.” This is where you put your emotions into the argument. Use [strong feeling words](https://copyblogger.com/trigger-words/) to really pack a punch.

Finally, tie it all together with the proposal. Craft your pitch with your parents’ concerns, the research, and your own desires in mind. (Ex. I would love to be able to do / have (privilege) because (research and reasons), and I want you to feel good about this decision by (address parental concerns and give them a way to keep you safe and monitor the situation).)

And if they’re not convinced, ask for the next best thing. Negotiate a situation that works for both parties–but is also a little uncomfortable. Show that you’re willing to put in the work to get the thing.

Doing this shows maturity, dedication, and your desire for the thing. Present it in a calm, open-minded manner and your parents are very likely to come around.

Here’s a quick example:

Mom and Dad, I completely understand your concerns regarding my driving with my friends, especially since I just got my license. But, our car scored the lowest overall probability of injury of any vehicle ever tested by the U.S. government's New Car Assessment Program. And, it’s the end of my junior year, which means I only have a little bit of time left with my friends–since we all want to go to different colleges. I want to make the most of it. If this is still not something you’re comfortable with, could I start with driving my sister, then reevaluate in a few weeks once I’ve had a chance to prove myself?

(Of course, complete the pitch with graphics and engaging slides.)

(I can drive with my friends now.)
