### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How my family and I are prepping for college
2. How you can help your kids prep, too
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

Happy Mother’s Day!! I am so beyond lucky to have my mom in my life and don’t know who I would be without her. She is truly the kindest, most beautiful soul I know. I love you, Mom!! Have the best day <3

In other news, Alpha High had prom last weekend!! The theme was Ancient Greece – which meant flowy, goddess-y dresses and backdrops of the ruins. It was absolutely stunning and I couldn’t have imagined a better event for my last prom.

I’ve also been in the throes of senior trip planning and figuring out how to use my dad’s credit card points to get our flights. Wish me luck :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: How my family and I are prepping for college

I’m pretty scared to go to college.

It’s miles and miles away from my family, my friends, and my home.

And at this point, my parents and I are so close that I can’t imagine not being able to give them a hug whenever I’m upset.

I intend to do things to keep us close while we're apart. And in the meantime, my parents and I have been spending these last few months preparing for my college journey. Somehow it feels like planning with them to leave makes me leaving feel like something we're doing together, instead of me leaving alone.

Here’s what we’ve been doing:

My mom has, on the whole, been helping me transition into a more independent, adult lifestyle. She’s helped me start calling in my medications on my own; we’ve tackled my skincare so I feel confident in myself; we’ve worked out together so I can continue to be active in college, and she’s taught me how to use an air fryer to cook. What I most love about all of this is that she’s established herself as someone I can go to whenever I have any sort of problem – whether that be an emotional one or a physical one (like my air conditioning not working – she taught me how to fix that, too).

Meanwhile, my dad and I have been doing things together that we’ll also be able to do while I’m in college. We watch a multitude of TV shows together that we then discuss. We send each other TikToks and X posts we find interesting. And I call him pretty much the moment something awesome, funny, or cute happens. I’ve always known I could ask my dad for help on the “big stuff” (and the more work or academic-focused stuff), but now it’s the little things that I want to talk to him about. And that’s going to keep our relationship strong.

### How you can help your kids prep, too

Here are a few things you can do to make the most of your kid’s last year at home to make sure you’re anchoring your relationship for the future:

1. Create habits

Start a daily or weekly routine. Watch a show together before bed, spend ten minutes before school catching up and chatting, exercise with each other on the weekends – whatever you and your kid enjoy doing.

The goal is to make spending time together natural – not something you have to plan or think about. When kids start getting ready for college, it can be super easy for them to get caught up in the craziness and not prioritize spending time with their parents. That’s why it’s more important than ever to establish a routine of quality time and love.

Make the most of these last few months.

2. Prepare for college together

If you find your kid to be super busy with college prep, then that’s what you should spend time doing together. Look for cute bedding together, teach your kid how to repaint their walls, and show them what they need to do when they get sick. Make sure you become an integral part of the college process so your kid feels supported going into it.

Also, if you help out with the prep, you’ll establish that you’re a safe person who can help out with college stuff. That way, if something doesn’t go perfectly when they actually get to school, they’ll be more likely to go to you for help.

3. Start to transition from treating them like a kid to treating them like an adult

This is probably the hardest one.

It will look different for every family, but you *have* to start letting your kid have more and more personal responsibility. They’re about to be miles and miles away from you, and they’ll need to rely on themselves to keep everything going.

You don’t want to just throw them off into the deep end – you want to make sure they’re prepared.

Start loosening their restrictions, have them manage their own appointments and money, and when they come to you for help on something, help them problem-solve their way to the answer instead of just giving them the solution.

Make sure your kid is fully prepared to live on their own.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Asimovs-Foundation-Foundations-Prelude/dp/B01EFDEMS8)

I’ve taken a bit of a break from the *Dune* series and moved on to the *Foundation* series. I’d already watched the show with my dad and found (at the very least) the second season to be pretty interesting, so I was excited to dive into the next series of my sci-fi journey. And I wasn’t disappointed. *Foundation* is almost an antithesis of *Dune*. Both cover the preservation of society, but go about it in extremely different ways. *Foundation* is about preservation, while *Dune* is about progress. I’m excited to continue reading *Foundation* and debate the merit of each book with both my friends and my parents (you should try it out, too).

2. [Survivor Season 31](https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Survivor:_Cambodia)

On a different note than last week, season 31 of Survivor is one where there are *no quitters*. There’s a female alliance of three in a tribe of ten other players who don’t like them, but they don’t let that stop them. Kelley Wentworth is an absolute icon and the season is full of dramatic moves and broken alliances. If you want a story of motivation and rising from the bottom for your kid, watch this season.

3. [My best friend made it on Brett Cooper’s show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5QTE23lkg)

Every time I feel like my friend Grace Price (@travelingenes on X) has “made it”, she surprises me the next day with something else even crazier. Brett Cooper made a YouTube video about her documentary and called out the major corporations that fund cancer research with a conflict of interest. The video already has over 150K views and continues to grow.

She’s attracting influencers across the nation who know she’s doing something amazing.

And she’s only 18 years old.
