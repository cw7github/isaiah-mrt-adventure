### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: My family’s communication challenges
2. How an online test can save your family’s internal communication
3. Scholar’s Sources: My favorite mental health resources (for mental health awareness month)

It’s been a pretty quiet week for a change. I’m just wrapping up my junior year academics and starting to dive into college admissions preparation. The latter of which is a bit scary, but we’ll get to that in future weeks.

On another note, it is the final week of Mental Health Awareness Month, so I thought a mental health-aligned newsletter was due. Learning about communication styles has been super helpful in my family’s growth (and all of our mental health), and I’m really excited to share everything I’ve learned with you.

### Austin’s Anecdote: My family’s communication challenges

​​I like to think I’m a logical person–most of the time. Unfortunately, I’m also a teenager. An emotional, dramatic teenager who doesn’t know who she is yet. While this isn’t a *bad* thing, necessarily, it does make it extra challenging to handle conflicts with my parents.

I’ll be making a rational, clear argument one moment, then be crying and frustrated the next, with no clue why. Which is hard on both of my parents: my super rational, analytical dad and my loving, sentimental mom.

When we try and communicate our feelings, no one’s happy. My dad states facts, my mom is empathetic, and I use a confusing mix of facts and feelings that no one but me understands. Let me illustrate:

My dad: Austin, we need to put screen time limits on your phone. You need to focus more on school.

Me: Well, half of my time on my phone is related to Twitter and learning new things. The other half is a brain break.

My mom: We feel like it would do you some good to talk to us and do things as a family instead of being on your phone.

My dad: And, you’re 1,000 Twitter followers behind your target goal, so you can probably be spending your time on Twitter in a more productive, less time-consuming way.

Me: So you want me to get more followers but spend less time on Twitter?!

My mom: Let’s talk about this further and create a screen time boundary that everyone is happy with.

Me: \*gets emotional because I’m overwhelmed and a bit hurt that my parents don’t think I’m putting enough effort into school and our relationship\*

My dad: \*freaks out because he doesn’t know what to do with crying\*

My mom: We can table this discussion and come back to it–

Me: \*storms out of the room and dramatically slams the door\*

Yeah, it’s not very productive. Our conversations are impacted by our inability to recognize each other’s communication styles and manage each other’s different strengths and weaknesses. My dad and my similar communication style often leads to a lack of authenticity and hiding behind logic. And my mom and I sometimes clash because I don’t take her feelings into account when I’m talking.

One important thing for me to mention is that *no one did anything wrong*. We’re simply different people who react differently to situations and experiences. But we *have* learned some things (through lots of trial and error) that have helped us communicate better.

I’ve already talked about some of the logistical changes in my newsletter, [how texting saved my relationship with my parents](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-53-how-texting-saved), but the deepest change came from being able to understand each other.

But, in order to understand each other, you must first understand yourself.

I’m analytical. I love creating and using templates. I’m a decent writer. And sometimes, if my thoughts aren’t written or planned out, I can get blinded by my emotions and shut down in conversation.

My parents want details, action items, and authentic emotions. They’re both great at listening and compromising.

As we’ve uncovered all of our strengths, weaknesses, needs, and communication styles, we’ve come up with a system for having challenging or deep conversations.

When we have something we want to discuss, we set a future date to talk about it, so that all parties have the chance to compose their thoughts. Then, I follow the [DEARMAN](https://dbt.tools/interpersonal_effectiveness/dear-man.php) template (I adjust it when needed) to explain my position and narrative regarding the situation. My parents do the same. We share our Google Docs with our DEARMANs and we make comments on each other’s Docs. Eventually, we arrive at a solution or compromise, and we discuss in-person if needed.

The templates help keep a balance of rationality and emotion for me. My dad loves the “business transaction” aspect of it, and my mom loves how my emotions and thoughts are clear in my writing. It’s not perfect, but it gets the job done.

The three of us have learned to navigate our individuality to create a space where we can have those hard conversations without straining our relationship.

I like to think it makes us happier people.

### How an online test can save your family’s internal communication

My family was able to navigate our problems because understood our own strengths and weaknesses and how we communicate. (And just to be clear, this didn’t happen overnight. It took a lot of effort).

So, you might be wondering: how can you replicate this?

Well, the first step (this is what my family did) is to take the [Clifton Strengths Finder test](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252137/home.aspx).

This test is designed to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses in four categories: executing, influencing, relationship building, and strategic thinking.

Here is my results page after I took the test:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aDqN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d142fb4-b41e-4009-98b0-10bf6e3a5546_1260x1362.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aDqN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d142fb4-b41e-4009-98b0-10bf6e3a5546_1260x1362.png)

It’s pretty clear that I have executing strengths, but that I’m not so strong in influencing or relationship-building.

Aside from this great visual view of my strengths and weaknesses, Clifton Strengths Finder also provides a “report” that includes descriptions of the type and action-items to make the most of your strength (my type is Achiever, which isn’t really a surprise).

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LNuv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ab04b2d-62fc-40a1-8400-427e56b99c26_980x1002.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LNuv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ab04b2d-62fc-40a1-8400-427e56b99c26_980x1002.png)

You can then use this report to guide conversations.

For example, to support my top type, Achiever, I should set measurable goals and take moments to enjoy my successes. To bring this back to the screen time example, my parents and I came up with the solution to only use social media after I’ve met my academic and Masterpiece goals for the day. We checked both boxes for me: measurable goals (completing my to-do list) and enjoying successes (being able to use social media once everything is done).

Instead of arguing over screen time, my parents were able to appeal to my strengths and abilities to come up with a solution to make everyone happy.

There is also a free version of the Clifton Strengths Finder test called [High Five](https://test.high5test.com/). You won’t receive the detailed report (so Clifton Strengths Finder is more helpful), but if you want to get a sense of the test, High Five is a great place to start.

It seems incredibly simple, but taking time to get to know your own strengths (and those of your kid) makes such a huge difference in the quality of your relationship.

There are far fewer heated arguments and tears in our house since we all took the test and found a communication style that works for us.

I want every family to get to have that.

### Scholar’s Sources: My favorite mental health resources (for mental health awareness month)

Since it’s Mental Health Awareness month, I also want to share a few of my favorite mental health resources (if you’ve been around for a while, you’ll know this is a topic I’m passionate about):

The CDC wrote [this article](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/mental-health/index.htm) that provides mental health statistics in teenagers and action plans for schools, families, and healthcare providers.

[Here](https://theyouthalliance.com/resources/help-hotlines/) is a list of mental health hotlines. While it might not be your kid, making these hotlines known can be the difference between life and death. Your teen might find themselves in a position where knowing who to call is what saves their friend’s life.

CNN wrote [this article](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/31/health/mental-health-teens-worse-pandemic-wellness/index.html) outlining how the pandemic drastically affected teenagers’ mental health–in a super negative way. Feelings of loneliness and hopelessness rose to 44% in teenagers because of the quarantine. Teens’ grades weren’t the only thing affected by life on Zoom.

[This](https://online.maryville.edu/online-doctorate-degrees/bsn-to-doctor-of-nursing-practice/high-school-mental-health/) is a really great article that has a ton of resources for parents that explain teen mental health from the parents’ perspectives – which is what I can’t give you.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txJGm6zhiBA) is a heartbreaking, emotional YouTube video of a TED Talk that a teenager gave about her experiences with the lack of communication on mental health in society.

SAHM compiled [a list](https://www.adolescenthealth.org/Resources/Clinical-Care-Resources/Mental-Health/Mental-Health-Resources-For-Parents-of-Adolescents.aspx) of resources for parents with struggling adolescents. Again, many of these provide the adult point of view on supporting teens.

[MindShift](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief/id634684825) and [InnerHour](https://www.theinnerhour.com/) are two absolutely fantastic apps that help teens develop healthy coping mechanisms and encourage teenagers to recognize their emotions. Regardless of whether your child is struggling with mental health or not, these apps are a really great way to begin a theme of acceptance and safety concerning mental health.

Finally, [this affirmations app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/i-am-daily-affirmations/id874656917) is quite possibly the most valuable thing on my phone. The app sends a notification with a feel-good affirmation every hour, and it has seriously changed my life. Especially with finals and APs, getting a little notification telling me that “everything will be okay” has been incredible.
