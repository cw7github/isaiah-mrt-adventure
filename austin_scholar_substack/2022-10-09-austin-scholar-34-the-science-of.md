### **Hey, y'all!**

You know when your teen gets frustrated when doing their homework and says "*I'm never going to figure this out?*"

There's absolutely a right way and a wrong way to respond to that.

And that statement might be (read: is probably) an indicator of a much deeper problem with how they see the world.

One that's likely crippling them–and one that you can help fix.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

[Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/) Cohort 9 launched on Wednesday, and I’m taking it again as a student. It’s really cool to be in the course after working for Write of Passage for a few months. I’ve gotten to see the incredible work that goes into creating each live session and the constant improvement that the company strives for.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I Made Myself Miserable By Thinking Twisty Thoughts

I used to see the world in black and white.

Yes and no.

Best and worst.

It made perfect sense to me. The world needed to have order or everything was jumbled up and messy, and my OCD brain did *not* like jumbled up and messy things.

So, everything had to be binary. Everything went into categories, and those categories were how I made sense of the world.

Boxing up the world, the good versus the bad, happy versus sad, easy versus impossible, was simply addicting to me.

Unfortunately, this type of thinking applied to myself, too.

If I wasn’t the best, I was the worst.

If I didn’t have a bunch of friends, I had no friends.

If I wasn’t super smart, I was incredibly dumb.

Yeah, it wasn’t great.

Since it isn’t possible to be perfect at everything in my life, it got to the point where I was super unhappy with myself–because, as my logic went, if I wasn’t the best at something, I was the worst.

I didn’t want to try cool, new things because I knew I couldn’t be the best at them, which made me miss out on a lot of experiences.

I got really mad at people really easily, because if they didn’t tell me I did a good job (at making dinner, being a good friend, etc.), I assumed they were telling me I did a bad job.

My brain cast a negative light on a lot of the good things in my life–simply because they weren’t perfect.

After my parents noticed these thought processes, they told me to read *[The Happiness Trap](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Trap-Struggling-Start-Living/dp/1590305841)* by Russ Harris.

Let me tell you: this book was absolutely ridiculous.

*What do you mean “my thoughts aren’t facts?!”*

*“I am not my thoughts?” What kind of propaganda is that?*

Page after page, *The Happiness Trap* kept giving me all of these reasons why my black-and-white mindset was hurting my life.

Why, even though I thought my mindset and my boxes were increasing order and decreasing anxiety in my life, it was actually doing the opposite.

I was making myself so much more anxious because of my sky-high expectations for myself and the world around me. I was constantly on edge because I had to make sure that *I was the best* or else *I absolutely failed*. Apparently, that’s not a great way to live your life.

And even though I thought those high expectations were motivating me to do my best, they were actually making me give up because I didn’t want to fail.

It was an extraordinarily shocking realization for me–one that didn’t come easy.

I had many midnight battles in my brain and arguments with my own thoughts before I realized that my mindset wasn’t healthy.

And even after I accepted that I had to change something, rewiring my brain and thought processes took *ages.* I spent so long in black and white that I had to relearn the colors.

Red, yellow, and blue entered my world after weeks of defusing (detaching or unhooking from difficult or unhelpful thoughts–not as easy as it sounds).

I was reminded of orange, green, and purple after learning expansion (the technique for accepting your unpleasant feelings–takes *a lot* of practice).

*And wow, was everyone’s world always this vibrant?*

Taking apart my boxes and realizing that this world isn’t a black-and-white world has made me enjoy all of the different colors around me. My life is much happier now.

### The Science of Cognitive Distortions (Or Twisty Thoughts)

Later, I learned this “black and white” thinking I experienced has a fancy name: cognitive distortion.

Cognitive distortions are “exaggerated or irrational thought patterns.”

But “cognitive distortions” and its definition sounds too fancy and scientific for such a common thing, so I’m just going to call them “twisty thoughts.”

Twisty thoughts are basically when your mind plays tricks on you and tries to convince you that how you’re feeling is 100% fact.

If you’re angry and frustrated, then the entire world is out to get you.

If you’re sad, then good things are just a precursor to bad ones.

Twisty thoughts essentially put [distortion goggles](https://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/distortion-goggles) on your mind.

Unfortunately, it can be super easy for teenagers to fall victim to twisty thoughts.

Here are some common twisty thoughts that you might recognize (from yourself or your teen):

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gRnF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9eea8f1d-90e0-42f8-888f-65398ace36b5_870x1160.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gRnF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9eea8f1d-90e0-42f8-888f-65398ace36b5_870x1160.png)

Obviously, the twisty thought that most clearly affected me was all-or-nothing thinking.

And maybe it’s easy to recognize overgeneralization or labeling, but there are a few *undercover* twisty thoughts that definitely need to be brought to light.

For example, my favorite one: should-ing yourself.

Saying things like “I should’ve studied harder” or “I should’ve gone to bed earlier” are actually twisty thoughts.

When you should yourself, all you’re doing is making yourself feel guilty. Instead of should-ing yourself, problem solve.

Make a study plan for the next test or turn on screen time limits on your phone.

Don’t needlessly make yourself feel guilty.

One more example of an undercover twisty thought: disqualifying the positive.

This is a super dangerous twisty thought for high school students.

Because of how overpowering school can be, anything positive that they’ve done in a day can be completely overshadowed by one poor quiz grade or by failing to understand a concept in math.

If they finished a good book they were reading, but they couldn’t figure out their trigonometric identities homework, then the entire day was a failure.

Because “I like to read, so it doesn’t matter that I finished a book,” or “I won’t get a grade for finishing a fiction book.”

A lot of teens disqualify the good things that they do if they enjoy doing them. A lot of schools encourage the idea that for something to have value and be worthwhile, it can’t be fun.

Just reminding your teen of the great things that they are doing can help them to unravel the twisty thoughts.

Now, you might be wondering, *What should I do if my teen has twisty thoughts?*

Well, the best thing for you to do is to help them neutralize their thoughts. Unwind them.

Like untangling a knotted rope, you can't just make the knots go away. You have to slowly tease them out–gently–or they'll just get worse.

It is *extremely challenging* to go from “I can’t do anything right” to “I’m amazing.”

Speaking these platitudes of “you’re great!” and “you’re awesome!” often won’t help your teen at all, simply because they don’t believe it.

Instead, help them go from a negative thought to a neutral one.

If your teen is getting frustrated while doing homework and you hear them say “I’ll never figure this out,” instead of saying “Yes, you will,” try “It might take you a bit longer, but you’ll grasp it.”

Or maybe your kid is going through a friendship breakup and they say “No one likes me,” instead of saying “That’s not true,” try “Some people might not like you, and other people will.”

Suddenly, these thoughts are a lot easier to believe.

You’re not trying to get them from one extreme to another. Rather, you’re trying to help your kid take off their glasses and see the world as it truly is.

Your frustrated teen doing homework won’t *never* understand something. They also won’t *always* figure things out right away. It might take them a bit longer to figure it out, but they’ll get it.

It’s not realistic to say that *no one* likes your kid, but it’s also unrealistic to say that *everyone* will.

And two important things to remember: your kid didn’t twist the thoughts on purpose, and it’s hard for them to unravel them on their own.

Don’t minimize their problems or simply tell them that they are being unreasonable. Our brains have a way of making us see the world like we’re in a [fun house](https://www.amazon.com/Fun-Express-13774233-Carnival-Mirror/dp/B07NF2SLWW/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=funhouse+mirror&qid=1665099930&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI0LjY2IiwicXNhIjoiNC43NiIsInFzcCI6IjQuMjMifQ%3D%3D&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExSElCVDBDT0dIVTNRJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODIxODQwMzVHS0xJVThXWFpPSyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTE4NjczTUFDUENMSUxPSUtHJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==). Blaming your kid or hoping the thought will disappear can only hurt them.

All you can do is try your best to support your kid and help them unravel their twisty thoughts.

### Scholar’s Sources: The Best Resources for Understanding Twisty Thoughts

[This](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-to-recognize-and-tame-your-cognitive-distortions-202205042738) is a fancy article by Harvard Health that does a deeper dive into specific twisty thoughts (they call them by their boring name, cognitive distortions) and direct examples of neutralizing them. [This article](https://www.schoolcounselorworld.com/Blog/SinglePage?Title=Helping%20Kids%20Change%20Their%20Cognitive%20Distortions) and [this article](https://cadey.co/articles/cognitive-distortions) are also great resources for getting a further understanding of twisty thoughts.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Niy54VJWPFE) is a super fun YouTube video that has amusing graphics and representations of twisty thoughts, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ThUrVXz9j0) YouTube video goes into the “why” behind our twisty thoughts.

Remember *[The Happiness Trap](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Trap-Struggling-Start-Living/dp/1590305841)* by Russ Harris? Well, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzUoXJVI0wo) YouTube video is an interesting metaphor animation by Harris on solid ways to neutralize and separate yourself from twisty thoughts. I highly recommend checking this one out. The techniques of [defusion](http://thehappinesstrap.com/category/defusion/#:~:text=Detach%20or%20unhook%20from%20difficult,pleasurable%20experiences%20(savouring%20skills).) and [expansion](https://bestillandknow.com/2014/08/01/the-happiness-trap-expansion/) that this video is based on are what helped me most with unraveling my twisty thoughts.
