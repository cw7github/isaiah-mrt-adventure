### **Hey, y'all!**

I used to be an anti-TikTok snob.

Now I think TikTok is one of the most underrated places for teens to learn - and a great way for teens and parents to strengthen their relationships.

TikTok is full of useful information if you know where to look.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

3. Scholar’s Sources: The Best TikTok Accounts To Follow

Last weekend was quite honestly the best weekend I’ve had in a while. I got to go to the World Series. The actual. World Series. Where the Astros became champions. (Thanks, Dad.)

I had an absolutely incredible time with my friends, watched stunning baseball, and had iconic, once-in-a-lifetime moments as we walked out of Minute Maid Park with fireworks and cheers surrounding us.

([Also, since the Phillies lost, maybe we won’t be going into a recession?!](https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/1585650041930268672?s=20&t=OYckyEkVfQih3Prr3aMUSw))

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I Became A Reluctant TikTok User

I'm not going to lie: up until a few weeks ago, I was a TikTok hater.

I was definitely one of those pretentious academic kids who thought TikTok was beneath them.

I felt like I already wasted a ton of time on my phone (as seen by my embarrassing screen time reports each week). I really didn't want to add on more hours of scrolling.

And, of course, I'd heard all of the anti-TikTok arguments about how TikTok causes a decline in teen mental health. As someone who struggles with mental health, I didn't want to add to that, either.

I just wanted nothing to do with that mess.

And for a while, I was pretty proud about not having TikTok. I definitely judged the popular girls who spent lunchtime doing TikTok dances in the bathroom, too.

Occasionally, my sister would send me a funny TikTok about why it makes perfect, scientific sense that younger sisters have messy bedrooms and I would laugh and get an urge to download the app so I could find more videos like it.

But I refused.

Until this year.

As a writer, I chose to build my audience for my [Alpha Masterpiece](https://alphahigh.school/) on Substack and Twitter. My friends, who are not writers, chose to use TikTok.

After a few weeks of constantly hearing my friends talk about their viral TikToks and not being able to watch them, I made the jump.

I downloaded TikTok.

"All to support my friends, of course," I told my parents.

I didn't want to admit it even to myself, but secretly I also wanted to watch more TikToks on science and messy bedrooms.

The first few days I had TikTok, I tried to continue my anti-TikTok agenda. I *only* watched my friends' videos and set 10-minute screen time limits for TikTok.

But then, one day, I opened TikTok and was about to click to search for my friends' accounts, when I saw a video with a caption that looked suspiciously like a newsletter I had written a few weeks ago.

The video was about Ellen Delle Donne of the Washington Mystics, the greatest free throw shooter of all time. She has a higher free throw percentage, by *a lot*, than anyone else in either the WNBA or the NBA.

The TikTok goes into how Donne was able to have such a high success rate.

Her secret? Consistency and simplicity in her routine and form.

Sound familiar?

In October, I wrote an article about how J.D. Martinez became the best hitter in baseball through daily practice, and how his habits can be applied to things outside of sports.

After watching that video, I started to dive deeper into TikTok. Much to my surprise, I found a ton of super engaging content.

The next day, I canceled my screen time limit.

I've spent the past few weeks on TikTok finding tricks to help with math, advice on college admissions, relevant world news, and so much more.

I've realized that TikTok can actually have a ton of value–value I wouldn't have known about if I had continued my screen time limits.

### Don't Put Screen Time Limits On TikTok (& How To Make TikTok Valuable For Your Kids)

I won’t sugar-coat it: TikTok *does* have dangerous, inappropriate, and time-wasting content on its platform.

It exists.

And, yeah. Sometimes teens willcompare themselves to people who put filters on their videos and will end up thinking they aren’t pretty enough. .

But, here’s the thing: most kids don’t *actually* want to spend their time watching bad videos and comparing themselves to TikTok stars.

What they do want, though, is the dopamine kick.

The short, punchy videos give kids a huge burst of dopamine–regardless of what they’re about.

So, most kids just fill their TikTok feed (called a For You Page) with anything that gives them that rush–which is, of course, extremely addicting. This leads to hours of screen time where kids watch a ton of useless 15-second videos that “rot their brain.”

Most parents’ solution to the TikTok addiction is to simply add screen time limits to their kids’ phones.

Here’s the thing, though: screen time limits don’t actually stop the negative effects of TikTok.

Kids can still watch the “bad videos.” They can still “doom scroll” for as long as the limit allows. And, in true teenager fashion, they’ll try their best to find a way around the screen time limit.

All for that dopamine.

Plus, your kid will probably get really mad at you. Kids hate it when parents put limits on their teen’s technology. It puts you at odds with them – which isn’t helpful at all when you’re trying to build a cooperative and constructive relationship.

So, what should you do?

Instead of putting time limits on your kid’s TikTok, teach them how to use it.

There’s actually a ton of valuable content on TikTok. You just have to find it.

Here’s how you can teach your kid to curate a feed that they can learn from, (but that will still give them the dopamine kick):

**Step 1: Make a new account.**

Okay. This might not seem important, but I promise, it is. A lot of kids are *super* territorial over their For You Page–and any social media account in general–and won’t be too pleased with their parents digging around in it.

So, have them create a new account that they can use as their “learning” account. They’ll be a lot more receptive to this than you just telling them to re-do their For You Page.

**Step 2: Follow good people.**

This is the most important step. Following good people leads to a high-quality For You Page. Pick five to ten excellent accounts that your kid would enjoy learning from, and the perfect For You Page will start to form.

In Scholar’s Sources, I’ve got a few recommendations on where to start.

**Step 3: Comment on the top creators’ posts.**

If you encourage your kid to comment on the TikTok videos they learned something from, they’ll likely have more positive interactions on the platform if those creators respond. This will make them want to go back to those accounts and continue the connection, where they will watch more videos and learn more things.

Also, the more your kid comments on the good stuff, the TikTok algorithm will put more content like that on their For You Page.

**Step 4: Share your own videos with them.**

If you spend time on TikTok finding high-quality content and sharing it with your kid, you can help them find content that’s useful and relevant to their interests. More importantly, you’ll open up a dialogue with your kid about TikTok. Instead of being at odds with them (fighting their TikTok habit), you’re supporting them but in a constructive way.

Of course, I understand that a lot of these things sound like great things to do in theory. That doesn’t make them easy to take action on.

If your kid just doesn’t seem to want to talk about TikTok with you, here are some great places to start:

1. Ask them questions about TikTok.

A lot of kids are used to getting the “TikTok is bad for you” speech from adults, so bringing up TikTok can immediately put a lot of teens on the defensive. Asking them leading questions about the value of TikTok–or the good things about TikTok in general–could make them more receptive to talking to you about the app.

Some questions could be “What’s the most valuable part of TikTok,” or “Who is the coolest person you follow?”

2. Have them make the case for TikTok.

Act like you genuinely care about what they’re saying and like you want to understand TikTok better.

Doing this has the potential to encourage your kid to go on a passionate rant, which is a great way to open the conversation.

3. If your kid likes competitions, challenge them to become an expert on a topic (like 20th-century Gothic architecture or today’s news in the video game industry)–solely from TikTok videos.

Throughout middle school, on random weekends, my dad would come up with some sort of challenge or research project that we would talk about at the next family dinner. (Usually, these projects were academic, but my sister’s and my competitive nature meant we would do them anyway.)

You can set a one-hour timer where everyone in the family can try to find the best TikTok videos on the topic, and at the end of the hour, whoever can answer the most trivia questions correctly gets to pick dinner.

Yes, this might seem like a lot of work when slapping on a screen time limit takes less than a minute.

But it’s worth it.

Doing this–learning from TikTok together–is a *huge* opportunity for you to connect with your kid. Most parents completely miss out on it.

TikTok opens up hundreds of opportunities to talk to your kid about what they love and who they want to be.

One last note: this doesn’t mean that your kid’s TikTok can *only* have productive, informative videos.

I still have my favorite videos of the [Sturniolo Triplets](https://www.youtube.com/c/sturniolotriplets), comedy shows, and baseball news.

I just also follow the right people so I can also learn from my For You Page–and sometimes newsletter ideas–all while getting my daily dose of dopamine.
