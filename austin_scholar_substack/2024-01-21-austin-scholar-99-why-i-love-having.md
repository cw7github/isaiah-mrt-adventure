### Austin’s Anecdote: Why I love having tests to pass

I love tests to pass.

This might seem weird to have a teenager use the words “love” and “tests” in the same sentence. But it’s true.

Tests to pass are objective measures of success and are often used at [Alpha](https://alpha.school/) to prove that students have learned a specific life skill.

For example, the elementary-age students had to solve a Rubik’s cube, learn to juggle, and run a mile to prove they learned the skill of grit.

In high school, it gets a little more complicated.

As some of you [might remember](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-93-how-my-friends), a few weeks ago, a group of students was offered the chance to go to Mexico for the weekend to create a workshop on how to have a 75% chance of getting into an Ivy League college. But in order to go on the trip, we had to complete a test to pass: we had to review a list of ten students with their statistics and extracurricular activities and correctly explain whether or not they got into an Ivy League. (To demonstrate how hard this was, one student played their instrument in the president’s inauguration and was still rejected by Ivies.)

Everyone was freaking out about the test to pass and spent hours every day learning about college admissions and quizzing each other on example students. In the end, all of this studying paid off, and each of us passed the test.

The overall goal of this test to pass was to prove that we could add value on the trip – if we didn’t understand who would get accepted into an Ivy, how could we build a workshop about it? When we each passed the test, we proved that we were experts on college acceptances and that we would have insights to build into the workshop.

The trip ended up a success – primarily due to the knowledge we’d all accumulated during our time studying for the test to pass.

The Mexico trip is just one example. In the high school AlphaX program, as you may remember, we all build a masterpiece project. To get credit before graduation, our pitches (our overview of what we're building and why people should care) have to pass AI graders (pitching requirement), we have to reach 1,000 followers on social media (audience building requirement), and we have to confirm a group of mentors called a Board of Advisors (networking requirement). We can’t just have a goal to post on Twitter every day or write a good pitch. We need something tangible to show that we are becoming experts in each area.

And in academics, our high-standard test to pass (for high school students) is to get 100% on a standardized test in each grade level math exam, 5th-grade to Algebra. We can’t just finish an app, we have to prove we’ve mastered the content.

Oftentimes, I will, of course, struggle with completing the test to pass and just want to move on. But it’s that persistence – that continuous work to reach the goal – that displays true learning.

In the end, I always do appreciate having an “end product” to show for all of my work, even if it was hard to get there.

### How to use tests to pass with your kid

Why are tests to pass important? There are a few benefits: increased grit, specific goals, tangible end products, and super high standards in whatever you’re learning (to name just a few).

And with each test passed, kids learn the value of actually earning their “success” – and they build a habit of striving for excellence.

One thing that I personally love about tests to pass is how objective they are – how they force a lack of uncertainty and give you a clear definition of success.

Also, it allows the burden of “consequence” or “failure” to fall on the test to pass, not you. If you and your kid agree on a test to pass to get certain rewards, then there doesn’t have to be arguing later on about whether they’ve done enough work to earn the reward – they either passed or didn’t.

You can create tests to pass for a multitude of different things, but here are a few examples to make this idea more concrete:

1. Academic requirements

Say you want to get your kid started using adaptive apps, but want to make sure they’re actually spending time and learning the concepts. You can use the IXL testing feature to test them and once they master, say, seventh-grade math and get every score to 800 before the end of the year, they can get some reward.

This is a pretty objective measure and can be a great starting point.

2. Building a business

Now, let’s say your kid wants to buy a nice new toy (for my sister and I, it was American girl dolls). You can agree that if they make 50% of the cost of the toy with some lemonade stand-esque business, you’ll pay for the rest.

3. Chores

You can also use tests to pass to enforce things like chores. For example, you can create a system that tracks how many toys are left out at the end of each day. If your kid can get a streak of zero toys for a month, they can get some reward.

These tests to pass use both objective measures to determine success alongside a bribery motivation model – which I’ve found to be an exceptionally strong duo.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

I’m trying out a new format for this newsletter where I put my personal update along with the links to what I’ve been up to this week – let me know what you think!!

One week later and I’m honestly doing great. I had a much-needed break with the three-day weekend, and we had a late start on Tuesday, so I got to sleep in then as well. I had a quiet weekend – pilates, working on my backspin and camel spin in skating, watching movies with my family, and spending time with one of my best friends before he goes back to college. I appreciate all of your support over the last week and am so grateful for y’all :)

1. [The Amazon 6-Pager](https://writingcooperative.com/the-anatomy-of-an-amazon-6-pager-fc79f31a41c9)

In preparation for a new project of mine (more on that in the coming weeks), I’ve done a ton of research on the Amazon 6-page memo. As an introvert who would kill to have all of the meeting topics mastered and understood before even stepping foot in the room, I love this idea – and I’m super interested in figuring out ways to incorporate it into family discussions or more personal events.

2. [Rummikub](https://rummikub.com/)

My friends and I played Rummikub over the weekend – and my goodness, does this game have the potential to destroy friendships. Rummikub is a super fun and simple strategy game based on finding patterns. Highly recommend you check out this game and play with your family.

3. [The Mean Girls Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762114/)

As a proud theater nerd and musical-lover, the new Mean Girls was awesome. I loved the strength of the vocals and thought the movie was a great adaptation of the Broadway musical. I can’t say I recommend this if you don’t like musicals, but it was definitely a win for me.
