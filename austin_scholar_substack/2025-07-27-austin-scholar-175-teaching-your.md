### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Teaching your kids to think in bets
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

I’ve had a (thankfully) quiet week after the last month of traveling to London and then across the U.S. Even though I don’t have specific due dates for any projects, I’ve been doing my best to maintain some sort of schedule by reading business books, writing my newsletter, staying active, and hanging out with my friends. I do feel, though, that I need to put more effort into achieving my big newsletter goals (by posting on X) and beginning to transition out of just reading investing books and starting to apply what I’m learning. I’m mostly inspired by my sister, who is absolutely crushing this summer to prepare for college admissions.

If there’s anything that you want to see from my newsletter this summer (live Zoom sessions to answer questions, age-specific content, more short-form content on X, a redesign on Substack, etc.) please let me know!

### Teaching your kids to think in bets

As anyone who has followed me for a while knows, I *love* breaking down seemingly-illogical decisions into their smallest parts and making them understandable to everyone. That’s why *Thinking in Bets* by Annie Duke was one of my favorite books that I’ve read in the last few weeks.

Here's the gist: a professional poker player turned decision-making expert shows us how treating decisions as bets – complete with probabilities and uncertainty – can lead to better outcomes and less emotional turmoil when things don't go our way. The number one thing Duke argues is that we shouldn't confuse the quality of our decision with the quality of the result.

Think about the decision of whether or not to cram the night before a test. In one case, your kid starts studying for a test two weeks in advance, but still doesn’t do well because the teacher asked about a chapter they studied while they had a headache. In Duke's framework, that was still a good decision with a bad outcome. On the other hand, pulling an all-nighter and cramming might occasionally work, but it's a terrible decision that sometimes gets lucky.

When you teach your kids this distinction, you’re giving them permission to fail without feeling like failures. You’re teaching them that life is more like poker than chess (one of Duke’s favorite lines throughout the book) – that it’s full of uncertainty and hidden information, where you might make great decisions and still lose.

*Thinking in Bets* has a ton of fantastic exercises that you can start doing with your kids to help them become better decision-makers. Here are a few of my favorites:

> **1. The Percentage Game (& Saying "I'm Not Sure" & "Wanna Bet?")**

This foundational exercise combines several powerful strategies that transform how kids think about certainty and decisions. Instead of defaulting to absolute statements, teach your children to express their confidence levels with percentages.

The basic idea is to assign percentages to your opinions or statements while being willing to admit if you don’t know something. For example:

* Replace "definitely" with "I'm 90% sure"
* Replace "probably" with "I'm about 70% confident"
* Replace "I doubt it" with "I'd say there's a 20% chance"
* Normalize saying "I'm not sure" when genuinely uncertain

Not only will this automatically encourage your kid to think more deeply about their decisions or opinions, but it also encourages the people around them to engage with that percentage – the lack of absolutes indicates that they are willing to think about and workshop the claim.

If your kid doesn’t seem to resonate with percentages, perhaps ask them to put money on their claims. Duke's research shows that when people put money on their beliefs, their accuracy jumps from 58% to 71%. If your kid makes an absolute claim, asking "wanna bet?" immediately triggers more thoughtful analysis.

> **2. The 10-10-10 Rule**

When emotions run high, this exercise helps kids zoom out and gain perspective on their current crisis. The framework asks them to consider how they'll feel about the situation in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years.

**How to implement:**

1. Acknowledge the current emotion without minimizing it
2. Once they're ready to engage, walk through the time frames
3. Help them identify what actually matters long-term

**Example applications:**

* Failed test: "This feels awful right now. In 10 minutes you'll still be upset. In 10 months, when you're in the next grade, how much will this specific test matter? In 10 years?"
* Friend drama: "In 10 minutes you'll still feel hurt. In 10 months, do you think this argument will still define your friendship? What about in 10 years?"

The goal isn't to minimize present feelings but to prevent catastrophic thinking and help kids recognize that most "disasters" are temporary setbacks.

> **3. Pre-Mortems**

When making a decision, conduct a pre-mortem where you imagine the plan has failed spectacularly and work backward to identify what went wrong. This exercise invites people to think critically about flaws in a plan before committing to it.

**The process:**

1. State the decision or plan clearly
2. Fast-forward to a future where it went terribly wrong
3. Brainstorm all possible failure points
4. Adjust the plan to address these vulnerabilities

**Example pre-mortems:**

* Choosing a heavy course load: "It's the end of the semester and you're burned out, grades are suffering. What went wrong?" (Possible answers: didn't account for extracurriculars, underestimated homework time, no buffer for when sick)
* Planning a group project: "It's presentation day and your group is unprepared. What happened?" (Possible answers: no clear deadlines, unequal work distribution, no accountability system)

Pre-mortems make it safe to think about failure before it happens, leading to better planning and realistic expectations.

> **4. Decision Accountability Systems**

**"Be the Best" Reframe**

Instead of avoiding mistakes, compete to be:

* The best credit-giver when things go well
* The best mistake-admitter when you're wrong
* The best finder-of-mistakes-in-good-outcomes

Create family rewards for:

* Admitting "I was wrong about that" without being prompted
* Saying "I couldn’t have done it without my team members" after a success
* Finding learning opportunities in wins ("We won the game, but our defense was sloppy")

**Decision Swear Jar**

Create accountability for unproductive language and thinking patterns. Each "violation" requires a contribution (money, extra chore, etc.):

Banned phrases:

* Absolutes: "Always," "never," "everyone," "no one," "100%"
* Lack of self-compassion: "I should have known," "How could I be so stupid," "I'm such an idiot"
* Extreme attributions: Blaming an outcome 100% on skill or 100% on luck

**Truth-Seeking Communication**

Teach productive disagreement patterns:

* Start with agreement: "I agree with you that [specific points of agreement], AND I also think..."
* Ask for permission: "Do you want to just vent, or are you looking for help thinking through what to do next?"
* Request temporary truth-seeking agreements: "Can we put on our scientist hats for a minute and really examine this?"

Example conversation: Teen: "My teacher hates me, that's why I got a bad grade!" Parent: "Sounds frustrating. Do you just need to vent, or do you want to think about what to do next?" If they choose problem-solving, follow with something like: "I agree that it feels unfair, AND let's think about what percentage was the teacher versus other factors..."

Of course, none of these strategies will work unless your kids feel safe being uncertain, making mistakes, and admitting when they're wrong. Duke talks about how "it takes effort to acknowledge and explore our mistakes without feeling bad about ourselves." Being wrong is really hard for anyone to admit, especially in front of the two people they most want to be proud of them: their parents.

So what can you do?

1. Celebrate good decisions, not just good outcomes. When your kid makes a thoughtful choice that doesn't pan out, acknowledge the quality of their thinking.
2. Share your own percentages and pre-mortems. Let them see you being uncertain and planning for failure.
3. Avoid "I told you so" at all costs. Nothing will turn your kid off from admitting their mistakes more than if they’re expecting an “I told you so.”
4. Make changing your mind a strength, not a weakness. When new information comes in, model updating your beliefs. "You know what? I was 80% sure about that, but with this new information, I'm down to maybe 30%."

Teaching your kids to think in bets isn't just about making better decisions (though that's a nice benefit). It's about raising humans who can:

* Handle uncertainty without anxiety
* Learn from both success and failure
* Take calculated risks
* Admit when they're wrong without shame
* Make thoughtful decisions under pressure

And when things don't work out? They can look back and ask: Was it a good decision with a bad outcome, or actually a bad decision? Then they can adjust and move forward.

Your kids don't need to be professional poker players to benefit from thinking in bets. They just need parents who are willing to model uncertainty, create space for failure, and teach them that being wrong is how we learn.

Trust me – or rather, I'm 90% sure – your kids will thank you for it later.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Valuation](https://www.amazon.com/Valuation-Measuring-Managing-Companies-University/dp/1394279477)

One of the first books my dad bought for me in my investing journey was a 1,000-page textbook from McKinsey & Company on frameworks and equations to value companies. I’d honestly been procrastinating reading it because of how intimidating it looked, but I decided to start reading it the day I went to the tax office to update the registration on my car so I could get two unpleasant tasks over with at the same time. Nine hours later, I celebrated reading the last page by eating a chocolate chip muffin and taking a nap.

*Valuation* really is a monster of a book, and I definitely don’t recommend reading it all at once. The book itself does a lot of scaffolding – starting by explaining a simple equation and then decomposing it in the next chapter. For me, I had to update what I had read twenty minutes ago and alter my understanding of a concept I still wasn’t fully confident in. That being said, it really is the most extensive, clear explanation of how to value companies and put together reports.

If you do want to learn from this book, though, I’d recommend reading sections 1, 2, and 4 first (preferably not in one sitting) and getting comfortable with the more basic valuation techniques and what they mean for a company. Then, you can take on sections 3 and 5, which deal with super complicated adjustments to your valuation based on taxes, leases, options, banks, retirement, etc. These sections shouldn’t change your understanding of the companies and their raw numbers too much, they just give you a more sophisticated and complete valuation report.

2. [KPop Demon Hunters](https://www.netflix.com/title/81498621)

Please don’t judge me for the title, but KPop Demon Hunters is probably my favorite movie of 2025 so far. It’s the perfect animated kids movie – likeable characters, fantastic animation and soundtrack, understandable plot, and a ton of nuance for older viewers to watch and enjoy. The core message of the movie isn’t unique (the main character is hiding something about herself and she learns to accept it), but the movie has become a global phenomenon (reached #1 globally and helped Netflix grow their revenue by 16% YoY). Why? Well, Netflix used the soundtrack (both songs and the fictional KPop bands had record-breaking numbers on Spotify) to increase reach and awareness of the movie and had a super engaging, Korean mythology-inspired plot of demons stealing souls by singing KPop songs (think: the kid’s version of [The Devil Went Down to Georgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IM4RcQFa8c)) to support the main character’s arc of self-acceptance.

I, too, went into this movie thinking that the name was lame and had extremely low expectations (which is why I didn’t watch it until a month after its release), but KPop Demon Hunters truly blew me away. If you haven’t already, please watch this movie with your kid (ages 10+ according to Common Sense Media).

3. [Built to Last](https://www.amazon.com/Built-Last-Successful-Visionary-Essentials/dp/0060516402)

If you’ve ever wondered what makes a company a visionary in its industry (even compared to other industry leaders), read *Built to Last*. The book basically directly compares visionary companies (American Express, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, Walt Disney, Wal-Mart, etc.) with another impressive company in their industry (Wells Fargo, Bristol-Myers, Westinghouse, Columbia, Ames, etc.) to figure out what it is about those visionary companies that makes them incredible.

While there were some basic habits of these companies that I already learned about at Alpha (such as a BHAG – a Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal), the main concept throughout the book was how to balance “preserving the core” and “stimulating progress” – basically, how you stay true to who you are while continuing to improve yourself and keep up with evolving industries. The book offers a ton of strategies and habits to implement in your company to work this balance, but I really started thinking about what this concept means for an individual. On a personal level, preserving the core might mean staying anchored to your fundamental values, principles, and sense of identity. Meanwhile, stimulating progress could involve continuously challenging yourself to learn new skills, expand your perspectives, and adapt to new circumstances. But putting them together is the difference between evolving and completely reinventing yourself – one builds upon your foundation while the other abandons it entirely. This is a balance that teenagers particularly struggle with while trying to find their place in the world and one that parents can help their kids with.

Exercises that build off of the ones recommended in *Built to Last* are completing the [Ikigai](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-121-how-to-help-your) framework with your kid, doing a [Values Pie Chart](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-46-how-to-set-your), and vividly describing the life you want to have for yourself in the next year and working backwards to identify goals.
