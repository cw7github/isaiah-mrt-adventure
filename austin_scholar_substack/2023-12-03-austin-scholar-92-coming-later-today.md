### Hey, y’all!

My classmates and I took this weekend to work on a new product for Alpha High, so my newsletter will be delayed. Thanks for your patience – I hope you think the wait is worth it :)

Lots of love,

Austin

PS – when I first started, I never dreamed that if I didn’t post on a Sunday morning, I would get emails from subscribers asking if I’m okay. As an author, knowing readers genuinely look forward to your work is so energizing.
