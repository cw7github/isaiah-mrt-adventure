### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: This week’s Stanford freshman advice
2. Studying with songs (& how to crush US History, *Hamilton*-style)
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

*Apologies for the late newsletter – going to [Bay to Breakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_to_Breakers) at 4am dressed as a purple minion rounded out my sorority hazing for the week, so I went to sleep early last night to prepare and didn’t have time to send out this newsletter on time.*

This week’s newsletter is going to be a little shorter than usual because this last week has been one of the busiest weeks of my life. It’s Big/Little week for my sorority, so every day I’ve been sent on a ton of different missions and met so many new people, which has been really fun, yet exhausting. At the same time, I had my math midterm on Thursday (the last midterm of the year, yay!!) so I was studying every second I had to spare. It’s been such a fulfilling week – I feel so lucky to have the Big/Little experience that I did and I finished my last midterm of my first year at Stanford?! I’m so grateful for the life I have and can’t wait to see what the end of this year brings.

### Studying with songs (& how to crush US History, *Hamilton*-style)

AI in education is controversial because there seems to be data on both sides – it helps *and* it hurts.

I have strong opinions that, in most cases, using a simple chat interface (like ChatGPT) is useless for kids and 90% of them use it to cheat.

If you let kids use it at schools, you are condemning these kids to learn even less than they already do.

But that doesn’t mean that *AI* is the problem.

Let me give you a positive example.

At [Alpha](https://alpha.school/) the APUSH (AP US History) students — including my sister — copied the strategy of Hamilton and created an entire soundtrack of songs about US history. They used AI to generate lyrics that took the APUSH units and made it catchy.

[Here’s the playlist.](https://suno.com/playlist/f7d4cebe-6183-4c04-b147-cf0c87f7c29c)

And here’s an example of the first verse to one of the songs:

*🎶 [Verse 1 – From War to Revolution]*

*1754, French and Indian War,*

*Britain’s broke, so they tax us more.*

*Proclamation Line says “Don’t expand,”*

*Stamp Act hits—yo, we take a stand.*

*Townshend, Tea Acts, we resist,*

*Boston Massacre’s on the list.*

*Sons of Liberty lead the cry,*

*Coercive Acts? Unite or die!*

*First Continental Congress forms,*

*Common Sense shifts the norms.*

*Lexington, Concord—shots explode,*

*Declaration signed, the path is bold.*

I talked to the students after the exam and they were all confident that they got a 5 (the highest score possible) on the test *and* they said that they had a lot of fun studying by singing the songs.

Why music? Well, according to [Levine Music](https://www.levinemusic.org/about/news/how-music-affects-memory-and-concentration/), “music engages various areas of the brain, including those associated with memory and emotion, like the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. [Studies](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/music-can-boost-memory-and-mood) have shown that “music doesn’t just help us retrieve stored memories, it also helps us lay down new ones.” A tune connected to an event or information forms a kind of soundtrack, which, when replayed, can spark a recollection.”

I’ve definitely experienced this – I (like every theater kid), had a massive Hamilton phase, and when it came time for my US history final, there were *three separate times* that I answered questions through a Hamilton lyric.

Now, I will add a caveat – just listening to songs is probably not the best way to completely learn material (because you might miss some details or applications), but it’s an excellent way to group and remember information (i.e. great for studying!!).

After seeing the success of my younger sister’s APUSH songs, I decided I definitely needed to create one for my Math 52 midterm.

I started by giving ChatGPT all of my notes in the course and asked it to create lyrics to a country song based on them. Here’s a snippet of my favorite lyrics:

*[Pre-Chorus: Vector Groove]*

*🎶 Oh, is it conservative? I’ll check it out,*

*Nabla cross F equals zero, no doubt!*

*If partial Q over partial x equals partial P over partial y,*

*Then it’s path-independent, oh my, oh my! 🎶*

*[Chorus: Conservative Fields]*

*🎶 Let it flow, let it go, it’s conservative,*

*Path independence is how it lives!*

*With a potential function, f of x comma y,*

*The work depends on start and end, you see! 🎶*

*🎶 Let it flow, let it go, the curl is zero,*

*F equals nabla f, you’re the hero!*

*Line integrals are simplified,*

*From A to B, no need to decide! 🎶*

*[Verse 2: Line Integrals]*

*🎵 Scalar line integrals, they’re pretty neat,*

*Add up the “weight” along the curve’s beat.*

*It’s the integral over C of f of x comma y with respect to ds,*

*Arc length shines, no need to guess! 🎵*

*🎵 But the vector kind, it’s all about work,*

*The integral over C of F dot dr, no need to lurk.*

*Dot product magic, with dr’s flow,*

*It’s P times dx over dt plus Q times dy over dt, let’s go! 🎵*

Then, I put them into the AI platform SUNO (which creates full-length songs based on your preferences and lyrics).

After inputting my music preferences into SUNO (country, male voice, guitar and drums), [this](https://suno.com/s/KH2JlDYnbaLEzkU1) super catchy song was created.

I’m actually obsessed with the pre-chorus and used the path-dependent and conservative connection to make sure I was on the right track for a couple of problems during my midterm. And the equations for the line integrals and vector integrals? Absolute perfection.

So to recap, here’s the step-by-step for creating songs to learn with SUNO:

1. Input notes into ChatGPT and ask it to create lyrics to a [genre] song based on the notes (OR you can write the lyrics yourself!)
2. Create a SUNO account
3. Go to the “Create tab”
4. Copy and paste the lyrics into the “write lyrics” section
5. Add your song preferences (what instruments, genre, voice, etc.)
6. Title the song
7. Create

Then you can add all of your created songs into a playlist and spend your time studying!

This is a *super* easy process and can help your kid prepare for exams like nothing else.

And, honestly, this is just a fun activity in general!! I created a bunch of country songs about being at college and had a ton of fun messing around with the tool. I *highly* recommend using SUNO to help your kid study for their exams and have fun while doing it!

### Austin’s Anecdote: Advice from a Stanford freshman

This week’s advice is from the lovely [Sammy Shankar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sammyshankar/)!! She’s an actual math genius and has used her knowledge and skills to both help other people and develop research. Sammy is a great example of someone who took an academic passion and turned it into a [spike](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-112-my-complete-resource) for her application.

1. What do you think made you stand out to admissions officers?

I think my deep passion for math made me stand out. I always loved math growing up and wanted to explore it as much as possible in high school, participating in math competitions and attending a math summer intensive for two years in a row. I wrote a lot about my love for math in my essays, which reinforced math as an important part of my identity to admissions officers.

2. What advice would you give to parents on one thing they can do to help their kid get into a school like Stanford and stand out to admissions officers?

I think the biggest advice I have lies in freshman year of high school. I’d recommend prioritizing exploration throughout 9th grade—specifically by trying out clubs, activities, and other subjects that sound interesting. Don’t confine yourself to one thing so early on in high school.

3. What is one thing parents shouldn’t do to help their kid?

Don’t prioritize being “well-rounded.” It’s great to explore several things early on, but in high school, I’d recommend finding one or two subjects, areas, etc. you really like and try to take these interests as far as possible.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Austin, do better](https://x.com/KendallGPace/status/1919525327430185181)

Austin is failing its students. To quote this thread:

*In**Austin ISD, over half of students** — 38,000 out of 72,000+ — **attend schools where less than 50% of their peers are proficient in math.** Even worse, 25,000 students are in schools where fewer than 30% are on grade level in math. This is a crisis.*

***1 in 3 students in Austin ISD attends a campus rated D or F** by the state. Not just struggling — failing. This is systemic. This is unacceptable.*

*Some high schools — including LBJ, Travis and Northeast — have **single-digit math proficiency rates.** That’s 90%+ of students entering adulthood without basic numeracy.*

I’m having a hard time articulating just how unacceptable this is. If Austin is going to be the foundation of this emerging tech hub, we need to do better and actually prepare kids for their lives here.

2. [Kids can write newsletters](https://x.com/gtmom/status/1918472077503238388)

I *love* to see stories like this (9yo writing a Substack newsletter) because not only does it add to this idea that kids are capable of so much more than you think, but it also showcases their natural curiosity and desire to share and talk about what they know and like.

Don’t dismiss these interests, even if you think they’re silly. Show your kid that becoming an expert is valuable and something to be proud of, no matter what the topic is. Listen to their rants, encourage them, even, so that they want to keep learning and sharing for the rest of their lives.

3. [Neurological reasons to be ambitious](https://x.com/Mindset_Machine/status/1921418342859980810)

This video uses science to explain why being ambitious is important:

* Ambitious behavior can boost neuroplasticity
* Obsession can increase dopamine and enhance motivation
* Obsession can focus your attention and see things in your field that others miss

Setting ambitious goals is one of the most important life skills I’ve learned, so here are some newsletters that I’ve written to help you get started and help your kid:

* [How to help your kid do impressive things. Period.](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-101-how-to-help-your)
* [How to help your kid set academic goals](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-129-how-to-help-your)
* [Creating New Year’s resolutions for you and your kid (that you’ll actually achieve)](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-97-creating-new-years)
* [How to use ChatGPT to break through goal paralysis](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-77-how-to-use-chatgpt)
* [Yes, You Should Bribe Your Teen](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-41-yes-you-should)
