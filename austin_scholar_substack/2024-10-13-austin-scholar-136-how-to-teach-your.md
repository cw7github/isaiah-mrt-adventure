### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: The magic of making your bed
2. How to teach your kids habit-building
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

If I wasn’t officially a college student before, I definitely am now: last week I got the freshman flu. It didn’t last for a long time – I only had a fever for half of a day, yet I still got so behind on everything.

I found myself getting super anxious about my school work and my ability to succeed at such a rigorous school. But instead of letting myself wallow in my obsessive thoughts, I got myself out of bed and hung out with my friends before locking in and getting back on track. Talking to the people going through the same thing calmed me down and helped to clear my head :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: The magic of making your bed

I make my bed every single morning.

I don’t do it because I want to keep my room clean or because I read those motivational books about why it’s important to make your bed in the morning to set yourself up for success.

I make my bed every morning because it’s been a habit since I was in fifth grade.

One of the requirements at Alpha was to complete a “stick-to-it-ness” goal, where you complete a habit *every day without fail* for thirty days.

I chose to make my bed every day. I set my alarm five minutes earlier (a tiny Austin couldn’t make her bed as easily as she can today – there were a lot of stuffed animals to organize) and made my bed immediately after it went off.

As simple as the task sounds, a lot of mornings (especially in the beginning), I would hate that I had to wake up earlier. I felt like it was such an arduous task to hoist my blankets off the ground and onto the bed – and my perfectionist side needed everything to look exactly the same every morning.

Even on the days I woke up late, I *had to make my bed*, so doing it efficiently it became a priority for me.

Eventually, though, it became an automatic task and I didn’t have to think twice about it. Even this very morning, I woke up to the majestic ringing of my alarm, almost fell out of my lofted bed, pulled up the blankets that had fallen during the night, and lovingly placed my stuffed animal in the center of my pillows.

I honestly don’t think I could stop if I wanted to.

The next stick-to-it-ness goal I did was cook dinner every night to prepare for my build-a-business goal, where I had to make $200 profit from a business. I chose to open a one-night only restaurant and invite all of my friends and their parents. I had a multitude of menu options and had to be ready to make every single one, so each night in the month leading up to restaurant day, I practiced by making dinner for my family.

And although it’s not really in the cards for me to make dinner for myself every night in college (my dining hall serves ice cream with every dinner, so you better believe I’m there for that), I can still make my entire menu from that night as if I’m on autopilot.

This practice with habit building has truly helped me improve my life as a whole – I used it when I started working out, when I started figure skating, when I learned how to french braid my hair, when I started journaling, when I began my morning gratitude journey…and that’s just a fraction of the list. I am a happier, healthier, cleaner, more self-sufficient person because of this skill.

### How to teach your kids habit-building

One of the most important things you can do for your kid is teach them how to make a commitment to themselves and stick to it.

If they master this concept early, their high school and college lives will be *so* much smoother, as they will be able to take small, yet lucrative habits (such as studying a topic for 20 minutes every day after school, working out, journaling, etc.) and implement them with ease.

Of course, most schools don’t have a stick-to-it-ness requirement for their students, so here’s how you can easily do the same exercise for your kid:

Spend about thirty minutes with your kid brainstorming potential ideas for habits or goals that you would *both* work on (examples will be in the following section).

In a school setting, it’s easy for students to feel community and camaraderie about doing these habits with their classmates. Since they don’t have that at home, you need to function as their peer.

It’s also important that, instead of a direct order or use of parental force, you will be working together towards this goal – they’ll get more out of it if they’re not being forced. Also, your kid won’t feel like this is some silly lesson that’s not actually that important because someone they respect is also doing it.

Next, plan for some fun activity to do together once you both complete the month of habit-building. This could be a themed movie night, a cookie decorating event, a trip to a trampoline park… anything that your kid would find enjoyable.

I also like this form of reward because it classifies time spent together as a treat, as something to look forward to.

During the first week, you should remind your kid to complete their daily habit, or even do it together. In weeks two through four, though, I would encourage you to try and let your kid remember on their own. If you’re reminding them too frequently, it will be significantly harder for them to learn how to build habits on their own later on.

Also, commend them for their dedication – ensure you’re acknowledging the work they’re putting in every day.

Some ideas for potential habits to build:

* Making your bed (pretty straight forward and good for all ages)
* Learn to do the splits (practice increasingly challenging stretches every day for 15 minutes)
* Learn to draw an object (do one version every day and try to improve one aspect of it each day)
* Make breakfast (get really good at cooking eggs in different ways, for example)
* Master multiplication facts through [Quick Maths](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/quick-maths/id1105735200) (primarily for younger kids)
* Learn to bake a complicated recipe (also instills directional capabilities)
* Run a 10-minute mile (can change the length of the mile based on age)

Learning how to implement these small habits into your kid’s daily routine will help them be able to do the same for the larger, more significant habits later on.

And who knows how those habits could change your kid’s life?

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [The standards for 5th grade students](https://www.tiktok.com/@iammrwilson313/video/7421320596677479723?_t=8qLxPuPuBpK&_r=1)

I came across this TikTok and was completely floored. Here are the standards for being in fifth grade:

* Write your name (in five years of teaching, he has not had a class where everyone passed)
* Reading beyond CVC words (consonant, vowel, consonant – ex. dog, cat, man)
* Not using fingers for basic addition (ex. 5+4)
* Know their address and their parents’ phone numbers (an apparent “hot take” the teacher has to defend every year)

These are the standards for our fifth graders. Reminder: these are kids 10-11 years old.

I am genuinely baffled at how completely schools are failing students if they can’t spell their name correctly by the time they’re ten years old.

2. [Nervous Conditions](https://www.amazon.com/Nervous-Conditions-Tsitsi-Dangarembga/dp/0954702336) by Tsitsi Dangarembga

As part of my *Why College?* class, we basically read every major education philosopher’s pieces to help us figure out what it is we want out of our college experience. This week, we read *Nervous Conditions* by Tsitsi Dangarembga, which is a coming-of-age novel about a young girl who does everything in her power to get herself an education. She grows corn and sells it to tourists so she can pay for her primary education and then is adopted by her uncle who takes her to his mission school so she can finish her education. At every turn she’s denied her education simply because she’s a woman. Her dad asks her if she “can cook books and feed them to your husband?” and tells her to “stay at home with [her] mother. Learn to cook and clean. Grow vegetables.”

One of my biggest impressions from this novel is how grateful I am to receive the education I’m getting – even when I’m struggling through exams or frustrated with professors, there are so many people around the world who would kill to be in my position.

Additionally, I love that the main character, Tambu, seems to just love learning. She says that “plunging into these books [she] knew [she] was being educated and [she] was filled with gratitude to the authors for introducing [her] to places where reason and inclination were not at odds.”

Tambu reminds me – in my darkest, most stressful hours – that reading is a gift and that I, too, find myself lost in stories and characters and am so blessed to be able to do so. *Nervous Conditions* helped me be at peace with my education and remember how lucky I am.

3. Mindfulness techniques

One of the classes I’m taking this year is called Frosh 101, where our senior RAs lead a weekly discussion on tools to help us navigate our first year of college. This last week was mindfulness techniques, and the reminders couldn’t have come at a better time. Throughout my chaotic, less-than-ideal week, I frequently used [square breathing](https://blog.zencare.co/square-breathing/), a [body scan](https://dialecticalbehaviortherapy.com/mindfulness/mental-body-scan/), and the [5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise](https://www.calm.com/blog/5-4-3-2-1-a-simple-exercise-to-calm-the-mind) to bring myself out of my head and back into reality. I know I’ve talked about these exercises before and they might seem a little silly (I know some people during Frosh 101 couldn’t hold in their laughter while they were being demonstrated), but I promise: if you take it seriously, these skills are life savers for any test anxiety, trouble sleeping, obsessive thoughts, and so much more.
