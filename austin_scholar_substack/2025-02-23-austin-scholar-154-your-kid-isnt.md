### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Your kid isn’t fighting you, they’re fighting for respect
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

I had an absolutely fantastic long weekend – I went skiing in Vail!! I felt like it was the perfect time to just be a kid and let go of all of the stress and responsibilities of college. I skied runs I wasn’t sure I was capable of, tried a ski jump for the first time, and embraced the needle-like snow that hit my face while speeding down the mountain. I also brought back a haul from the best candy store ever (Fuzziwig’s) for my roommate and I to enjoy for the rest of the week.

As much as it helps me to sort through all of my priorities and responsibilities, it did feel nice to ignore them for a few days and just have fun.

### Your kid isn’t fighting you, they’re fighting for respect

Have you ever approached your kid about a problem, knowing it was already doomed to turn into a fight?

"Why didn't you take out the trash today?"

"Why do you always talk to me like I'm four?"

You might remember that a few weeks ago, we talked about *10 to 25* by Dr. David Yeager.

This week we're back with more: this time, on how to handle disagreements with your kids.

Here's a quick summary of the core concepts for those that missed [the previous newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-151-why-you-and-your):

Parents and kids experience a disconnect between what they say versus what they hear, which is the core dilemma that David Yeager’s book, *10 to 25*, tries to fix. He explains that “it’s very hard to simultaneously criticize someone’s work and motivate them because criticism can crush a young person’s confidence” (pg 4). This disconnect creates something called the adolescent predicament, which “is simply defined as the mismatch between young people’s neurobiological needs for status and respect and the level of status or respect afforded to them by their current circumstances” (pg 45).

Basically: kids are wired to need status and respect, and a lot of times, they don't feel like they get it from their parents.

So parents and kids clash. And that becomes the "adolescent predicament."

In the previous newsletter, I explained how to talk to your kid in a way that both maintains high standards and support, and also avoids falling into this adolescent predicament.

But what about when you have a disagreement?

As all parents know, in arguments, the divide between parents and kids gets even more exacerbated. Why? Yeager calls this the “barrier of mistrust,” which “applies to people who have less power in a setting, and then have their status or respect questioned. When this happens they tend to assume the most unfavorable and antagonistic reasons for the questioner’s behavior. With status at stake, they will dissect each word, looking for deeper meaning” (pg 87).

Basically: when you and your kid are in a disagreement, it’s likely that you are subconsciously exerting your power and control over the situation to try and get the outcome you want. This is *extremely* threatening to your kid’s personal notions of the status and respect that they want to have in every situation. To compensate, they'll “focus more on the unsaid part than the said part” in an effort to reestablish their status in the relationship (pg 88).

If your kid isn't doing their chores and you confront them about it, your kid will feel like their respect and autonomy is being threatened (even though they know they aren't fulfilling their side of a bargain). They'll respond by telling you that your tone is too harsh and you're always so mean to them, not because it's true, but because it allows them to reestablish their status in the conversation (as a person who has been wronged, not just the one getting told off).

So, how should you work through disagreements?

Form “Treaties, not truces.” As Dr. Yeager says, “With a truce, there’s usually a conquering victor and a surrendering loser…With a treaty, both sides have assessed their needs. They have an awareness of what’s necessary for both parties to thrive despite potentially competing interests. They mutually agree on terms. Then they renegotiate as necessary, which means they must keep the lines of communication open” (pg 89).

What does this do?

* Shows your kid respect by being extremely clear with them
* Confirms their status by genuinely considering and working through their needs and desires to try to come to a mutual agreement

Basically, you’re collaborating and trouble-shooting – working together to come to a solution that’s beneficial for all parties.

How do you employ this? When you recognize an argument occurring and notice that you might be starting to espouse some of the “I’m the parent, so I know best” rhetoric that immediately puts your kid’s guard up, step away from the situation and calm down. Ask your kid to write down or record a video (whichever they’d rather) using the [DEARMAN](https://dbt.tools/interpersonal_effectiveness/dear-man.php) structure:

* Describe the situation
* Express your feelings
* Assert your ask
* Reinforce by explaining what the other person will get out of the arrangement
* (be) Mindful to keep focus on your goals
* Appear confident
* (be willing to) Negotiate

You must do the same thing (so you and your kid are at the same level!!) and then you can swap DEARMANs. Pay careful attention to the Negotiate section and, once both parties understand the other’s views, work together on that negotiation and put something in writing. Be extremely clear about what your resolution is – do *not* leave room for interpretation or loopholes (on either side). Create a treaty and reinforce your kid’s status and your respect for them by including them in the process and listening to their needs.

Now let’s say that there’s no massive disagreement about something. Instead, your kid is just struggling. Maybe they failed a test, stayed out past curfew multiple times, yelled at you, or anything else that showcases their challenges. Parents have two natural responses:

* Being an enforcer (maintaining only high standards)
* Being a protector (maintaining only high support)

Neither one of these options as a stand-alone is in your kid’s best interests.

Instead, you need both high standards *and* high support.

Here is an example of how this would work from one of the mentors in *10 to 25*. This is what she might say to a low-performer during a performance review (for anyone who’s watched [Severance](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/severance/umc.cmc.1srk2goyh2q2zdxcx605w8vtx), compare this to the Board’s performance review of Milchick…):

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_TD_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4438f917-0ccd-4aab-8347-7922d9f4887e_1600x1009.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_TD_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4438f917-0ccd-4aab-8347-7922d9f4887e_1600x1009.jpeg)

What a beautiful example of high standards and high support – the pinnacle of the mentor mindset. And I have some good news: you can pretty much copy-and-paste a majority of what she says into your own discussions with your kids. Here’s what that template could look like:

*I want you to know that [explain the situation]. I get it. It sucks. But I want to be clear with you. I don’t think that your [performance/abilities/etc.] in this situation are a reflection of your trajectory. I know what you are capable of. [Amount of time until the next situation], I don’t want you to have a narrative that you’re a persistent [low performer, not capable of math, rule breaker. etc.]. I want you to control the narrative to show that you’re a [opposite of that]. I have some ideas for what we can do over the next [time frame] to get there. But I’d like to hear from you. What are your goals in [this area]. How do you want to get there? Let’s spend some time working through these questions together. I will be there for you and will support you in any way that I can.*

This is what collaborative trouble-shooting looks like. You collaborate with your kid to get to the root of the problem and offer them support, while trouble-shooting the situation to continue to raise standards. Be extremely clear with your kid and try to not leave any room for confusion, or for them to worry about the unsaid. If you approach these situations with support and standards rather than with judgement and pity, you’re much more likely to get a better result.

Let me share an example from my own life so you can see how this might come into play:

I didn’t do as well as I wanted to on my math midterm a few weeks ago. My parents had three different ways to react here:

1. Yell at me for not working hard enough (high standards, no support)
2. Tell me that my grade is fine as is (low standards, high support)
3. Use the mentor mindset (high standards, high support)

If they were drawing from *10 to 25*, they might say something like, “Wow, that sucks. But I don’t think that your score on this one midterm reflects your entire college trajectory. I know what you’re capable of.

But after the second midterm, I don’t want you to have a narrative that you’re bad at math. I want you to control the narrative and show that you’re a great student. If you want, I can get your Math Academy account up again and sign you up for a linear algebra course, but there are obviously a ton of different options here. How do you want to prepare for the next midterm? How can I help you get there?”

High standards, check. They didn’t tell me that my score is okay.

High support, check. They offered to help me work through my problem.

Clear, check. It’s super obvious that they want to help me reach my full potential.

However, if you and your kid’s relationship isn’t super awesome, I might also add in a few lines about how you’re proud of them for being willing to accept help and that their scores don’t affect your love for them.

And remember: this stuff can take a lot of work. Sure, it’s easier to let your kid figure things out for themselves or quicker to just yell at them and hope they fix their behavior. It’s harder to sit down and work through their struggles together.

But in my mind, that’s what makes for a successful relationship. Don’t shy away from the mentor mindset just because it’s hard. It's one of the things that can make the biggest impact on your relationship with your kid in the long run.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Disappointing is not the word I would use…](https://www.wbgo.org/news/2025-02-19/nj-educators-ponder-next-moves-after-disappointing-test-scores)

BREAKING: 82% of students in Newark, New Jersey can’t do math at grade level, and 70% can’t read at grade level. If you live in New Jersey, your schools are failing your kids.

Educators continue to promise that COVID learning loss can be regained with our current system – they just need more money, more time, more resources… but I’m sorry to say that [it’s just not possible](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-152-americas-students). We’re five years past COVID and over 80% of our students still can’t perform at grade level? Doesn’t seem like the $200 billion has done enough – or *will* do much.

So when districts get these results back, it’s an insult to simply say they are “disappointing.” These scores should be motivating – should motivate change.

If the current system isn’t working, it’s time to switch to something [that does](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-153-how-alpha-students).

2. [The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_rYPu6meD8) versus [The Ones Who Stay and Fight](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-ones-who-stay-and-fight/)

I read both of these pieces for my Citizenship class and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about them since. The second piece, *The Ones Who Stay and Fight*, is about a utopian world called Um-Helat, which is a utopia because there is a group of “social workers” who kill anyone who learns about injustice or evil and could spread it to the rest of Um-Helat. This piece was written as a reaction to *The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas*, which describes a utopian world called Omelas that remains a utopia because of the continuous suffering of a child.

Although both short stories critique society in different ways, I feel like their utopias both rest on a mutated version of Hobbes’ Leviathan (a perfect society is one with a single, all-powerful ruler).

* In Omelas, the threat of the utopia disappearing if they help the child is their Leviathan.
* In Um-Helat, the social workers are the Leviathan.

I feel like we’re all similar to both the citizens of Omelas (who ignore suffering to maintain a high-quality life) and the citizens of Um-Helat (who ignore and put down knowledge that has the potential to destroy your worldview or hurt others). But of course, if the citizens of Omelas paid attention to the suffering, they would be dooming their world to dystopia, and if the social workers didn’t kill dissenters, the same would happen to their world. So what is the right balance between utopia and ignorance in our lives? How do you decide what knowledge is dangerous?

3. [The White Lotus season 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvNazSPTp0I&t)

I couldn’t finish this Scholar’s Sources without mentioning the number one thing that has taken up my thoughts this week: The White Lotus season three. I am truly, genuinely obsessed with this show and always find the characters so interesting to break down.

I’m not going to lie: this show is *really* weird. Pretty much every character does questionable things and there are a ton of social taboos that Mike White (the creator of the show) completely blazes through. But if you like character shows or are simply fascinated by humans, this is the show for you.

I’m going to be keeping up with all of the podcasts and theories for this season, and I hope to be watching the second episode with y’all tonight!
