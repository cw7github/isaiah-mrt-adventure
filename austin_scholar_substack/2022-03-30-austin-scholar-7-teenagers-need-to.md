### **Hey, y'all!**

Welcome back to the Austin Scholar newsletter!

Two days after I launched Austin Scholar on Substack, my Substack account was unfortunately deactivated because I was not 16 years old. The good news is that today is my birthday! For my 16th birthday, I got a Substack account, which was even better than my friend who got a car. It would be the best birthday ever if y’all could forward my newsletter to a few friends :)

Again, I apologize for that inconvenience and thank you for your support over the past month.

Over the course of the next week, I will re-publish each newsletter I have sent over the past month on Substack, so watch out for that.

By next Wednesday, I will be back to publishing weekly on Substack.

Today from Austin Scholar...

1. Teenagers Need to Learn How to Write Online
2. Three sources outlining the most valuable learnings from Write of Passage

### Teenagers Need to Learn How to Write Online

> Six months ago, I was writing five-paragraph-third-person-observational essays on books from the 1800s. These essays will not only get me through high school, but also teach me how to structure a basic argument with evidence, succinct reasoning, and adequate grammar.
>
> These essays, though, while a beneficial baseline, don't hold much merit outside of academics. Most of the population isn't captivated by writing in an academic-formal tone, filled with data and studies, and that has perfect grammar. This leads to many teenagers not knowing how to make people *actually want* to read their writing. **Teenagers need to learn how to write for the world, not just for teachers.**
>
> After I realized this, I decided to take David Perell's *[Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/)*. *Write of Passage* (WOP) is an online five-week course where [David Perell](https://perell.com/), "The Writing Guy," teaches people from around the world how to write online. **The most straightforward way to make an impact and share knowledge in the 21st century is to write online.**
>
> Though it has only been a couple of months since I took the course, these two concepts I learned through writing online have completely changed the way I think about writing in general.

1. Start POP Writing

> Schools specialize in teaching students how to write observational essays. This often leads to boring, dry writing. POP writing focuses on including **personal**, **observational**, and **playful** elements in writing.
>
> My friend, [Shaped by Sacred](https://www.shapedbysacred.com/), and I took WOP together, and from week one we had the observational part down. After writing twenty academic essays in the past year, we understood how to include insights and data in our writing.
>
> Unfortunately, though, because we had never been taught how to, we struggled with making our writing personal and playful. Neither one of us understood why anyone would care about our experiences and personal stories. About halfway through the course, though, we had a lightbulb moment.
>
> During one of the live sessions, Perell was editing an article about pancakes. The first part of the essay was an informational recipe on making healthy, vegan pancakes, while the second part of the essay was about the author's interactions with her children when she makes them pancakes. I'm not going to lie: I was so much more engaged when I read about the heartwarming, loving thoughts between a mother and her children than when I read the recipe.
>
> This helped me realize what was missing from my writing: stories and personality. The personal and playful aspects have just as much value–if not more–as observational aspects do in writing.
>
> The final pancake essay was a beautiful piece on the bonds between a mother and her kids, complete with a healthy pancake recipe to help other moms foster bonds with their own kids.
>
> *This second section is definitely super observational, so y’all can see the contrast between personal and playful writing and observational writing. Anyhow, I think we all need to send love to David Perell; imagine if every article of mine was written without any personality :/*

2. Create an Information Capture System

> Having an information capture system is the most valuable tool I gained from WOP. An information capture system is basically a fancy, organized note-taking system. Having a capture system allows me to save articles I find interesting, random shower thoughts, AP World History notes, and blog post ideas all in one place.
>
> Not only does this give me more content for my writing, but also allows me to do **ambient research.** Ambient research is learning and research that happens in normal day-to-day life. This could be a tweet that has an interesting insight that I find while scrolling through Twitter before I go to bed or a Wikipedia page that I end up at while procrastinating working on math. Ambient research is meant to happen naturally. This is contrary to active research, which is spending time specifically to research a topic. This is what high schools teach students how to do, but it can be draining and intimidating.
>
> Another fascinating part of an information capture system is that as the notes and information increase linearly, the connections between them increase exponentially. Even though I wrote the same amount each day, the relations between the notes and ideas grew rapidly. This allowed for more clarity in my thoughts, which leads to more content to write about.
>
> Finally, **note-taking is the closest we can get to time travel**. When I write something in my capture system, I am preserving my thoughts and experiences, so when I look back a few days, weeks, or years later, I am able to remember exactly how I felt and what I was thinking when I wrote that note.
>
> There are many great tools for starting an information capture system. I use [Evernote](https://evernote.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwiY6MBhBqEiwARFSCPi6_KqS05SkeT3GQtEajn3HFHBTirA_b_fDBrq7TOsO9Rwdg4zkqixoCIWsQAvD_BwE&offer=fp_prmt_generic_link_mktgweb_pers-L-paidmedia-respsearchv00&utm_campaign=webpaidmedia&utm_content=20210920-US-en-ooo&utm_medium=paidmedia&utm_source=website), but I know that [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product?gclid=CjwKCAjwiY6MBhBqEiwARFSCPpz9vTTHHBmUZsvkbtZO1N0hBU4aK26mIH7WB4F0rz347l7cij9vGhoCLYcQAvD_BwE&targetid=kwd-312974742&utm_campaign=2075789710&utm_content=500427479647&utm_medium=80211061601&utm_source=google&utm_term=notion) and [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app) are also excellent resources. [Building A Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/), an online course by Tiago Forte, is a fantastic course to help kick-start information capture systems.
>
> Writing online allows teenagers to connect with a wider audience and share their ideas. Their future relies on the internet, so they should prepare for it.

[This article](https://www.adamtank.com/new-blog/2020/4/30/the-cost-of-writing-well) by WOP Alumni, Adam Tank, outlines how Write of Passage influenced his career and life. He also talks about whether the expense of the course is worth it and what “you’re actually paying for.” The importance of building habits, accountability throughout the course, and building an online network are cited by Tank as what makes Write of Passage worth the cost.

Michael Ashcroft, another WOP Alumni, wrote [this article](https://www.michaelashcroft.org/blog/how-to-get-the-most-from-write-of-passage) about how to get the most out of the course. In this 4,000 word essay, Ashcroft introduces the Write of Passage modules and core lessons while using his personal experience to explain the benefits of taking the course. Additionally, he links to [Charlie Bleecker](https://www.charliebleecker.com/writing/write-of-passage-how-to-capture-the-value), the lead mentor during my Write of Passage cohort, who was an incredible inspiration and help throughout my WOP journey.

Building a Second Brain is a cohort-based course that teaches you how to create an information capture system, also known as your second brain. While I haven’t taken this course (it’s on my To-Do list, though!), [this article](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/) presents the highlights of the course. Even if you don’t have the time to participate in the next cohort, reading this article will give you an overview of information capture by the expert: Tiago Forte.

“​​By keeping a diverse collection of information in one centralized place, it is free to intermix and intermingle, helping us see unexpected connections and patterns in our thinking. This also gives us one place to look when we need creative raw material, supporting research, or a shot of inspiration.” –Tiago Forte
