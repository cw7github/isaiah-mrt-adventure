### **Hey, y'all!**

[Last week’s newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-26-three-ways-to-get) was for all y’all parents, but this one’s for your kids. I’m going to give you a list of the most **essential** apps, websites, and videos for going back to school, along with a message to the kids.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: What I’ve done to prepare for my junior year
2. A message to the kids
3. Scholar’s Sources: ESSENTIAL resources for going back to school

I’m officially switching my newsletter day from Wednesday to Sunday! Starting next week (on 8/28/22), I’ll be sending out my newsletters on “Scholar Sunday,” so make sure that you watch out for that.

I’ve also started to get pretty active on Twitter, so go follow [@AustinScholar](https://twitter.com/AustinScholar).

Also, today is actually my first day of my junior year of high school (I cannot believe that I am an upperclassman?!), so next week’s newsletter is sure to have some dramatic updates :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: What I’ve Done To Prepare For My Junior Year

Junior year. It’s a big one.

I’ve got to worry about the SAT and multiple AP tests for my academics, while also working on my newsletter and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AustinScholar) so that I’m an interesting person, while also completing the unique requirements of [Alpha](https://alphahigh.school/).

It’s going to be a lot.

In this newsletter, I want to share what I’ve done this past week to get myself organized and prepared for the school year ahead.

The first thing I did was start to get a decent sleep schedule. As I talked about in [Austin Scholar #10: Let Teenagers Take Naps](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-10-let-teenagers-take), sleep is crucial for both the physical and mental growth of teenagers. And let’s just say: I’ve been taking some “creative liberties” with my sleep schedule this summer and have grown used to late nights and sleeping in.

Anyway, I’ve been trying to get back on track with my sleep and getting a really solid midnight to 9 AM (only one hour later than I’ll have to wake up during school!) during weekdays.

I’ve been winding down at night by watching a **ton** of inspirational (and sometimes pretty cringy) YouTube videos. Watching them has made me actually want to start school again and partake in the motivational exercises in the video.

Of course, a key part of every video is purchasing school supplies.

While I was at Oxford, I actually bought a [notebook](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/ABOUT-BLANKS-BLACKWELLS-EDITION-by-ABOUT-BLANKS/2100000252763) at [Blackwells](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/home) (my new happy place) that used to be an old book called [“Some Principles of Fiction.”](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Fiction-Robert-1908-Liddell/dp/1014220483) Because of how super cool this notebook is, I really want to put smart things in my notebook. And to do that, I need to learn some things. Motivation, check!

In preparation for the smart things that would go in my amazing notebook, I brainstormed a list of goals for my junior year. I know a lot of these will probably change, but I wanted to get an idea of how I wanted this school year to go. Some goals include: sign up for writing competitions, spend 30 minutes on Twitter every day, and get a 1500+ SAT score.

Now, for academics, I watched overview videos on every single one of my courses so that I know what I’m getting myself into. Then, I printed out the “final exam cram sheets” I use right before my tests, just so I can get a little bit ahead this year.

The final thing that I’ve done for school preparation is create my time blocking system.

If I sleep for eight hours every night, then I have sixteen hours of daytime to work with.

I decided that I would dedicate four hours to intense academics. During this time, I will do app work and SAT and AP prep.

Then, I’ll have four hours to work on my Masterpiece (my newsletter, Twitter, and Write of Passage).

Next is four hours of miscellaneous work. This can be anything from working through the Aceable driving test, to entering writing competitions, to random non-academic school assignments.

Finally, I’ll have four hours of free time: time for me to do whatever I want. I can watch TV, spend time with my friends, or go on walks.

Obviously, my 4-4-4-4 system isn’t going to be perfect at first, but hopefully this, along with everything else I’ve done to prepare for junior year, will make this year be great.

### A Message To The Kids

So. It’s time for school.

I don’t know about y’all, but I’m not excited for hours of homework and a ton of stress and expectations and just… a lot of really hard stuff.

We expect this stuff to suck. But it doesn’t have to.

Spend time now organizing and creating good habits so you can start the school year off strong.

If you want to ace your SAT and AP tests, start prep at the start of the year, so the end of the year isn't a disaster.

Improve your mental clarity by getting some good folders and filling them with study packets. Create a study system.

Set super challenging goals that you really, *really* want to do, and go for it. (You’re not too young to do hard stuff.)

Have balance. School doesn’t have to be your entire life, and your assignments will consistently be of a higher quality if it isn’t. Plus, sometimes the best learning comes from what you do *outside* of school (like what I’m learning from writing my newsletter).

This is the time when you can experiment and try new, awesome things.

Start that Etsy shop. Write a book. Become a state champion swimmer. Bake 100 batches of chocolate chip cookies.

Make this year count.

You’ve got this. Just remember to breathe.

### Scholar’s Sources: ESSENTIAL Resources For Going Back To School

Here are a few absolutely essential websites, apps, and ideas that your kid needs before going back to school:

#### Apps

1. [Flora](https://flora.appfinca.com/en/)

Flora is one of the best apps I know to combat procrastination. It’s a Pomodoro timer where you grow a virtual tree during the 25-minute Pomodoro, and if you go on your phone, you kill the tree. It just takes one second of motivation to click “start” on the timer, and you have 25 minutes of productivity. (You really won’t want to kill the tree.)

1. [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/)

Desmos is the actual best calculator in the world. It’s super powerful and the graphic calculator displays functions so beautifully. I have no words for how much I adore Desmos.

1. [Lucid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lucid-learn-visually/id1482780647)

Lucid basically takes popular, yet long and hard to understand books and breaks them down into their core concepts with visuals. If you’re struggling with an impossible book, check out Lucid for a simple, yet comprehensive summary.

1. [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)

I’ve been using Evernote for about a year now, and it has seriously changed my life. Evernote is an easy-to-navigate, extremely powerful notetaking tool. It’s super easy to organize and find notes, ideas, and thoughts.

#### Organization

1. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)

YouTube, of course, has so many organizational videos that can actually be super helpful. There are planner walk-throughs, back-to-school organization, Google Calendar tutorials, and so much more.

1. [Notion](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwjky6W-6ML5AhVvFkwKHU85CegYABAAGgJvYQ&sig=AOD64_3yBMR5zBqic53-_AKFZegK-q4UIg&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwisop2-6ML5AhX0lmoFHeQJBfoQ0Qx6BAgDEAE)

Notion is my new favorite organizational tool. I have, like, four separate boards that sort the same information in different ways. I HIGHLY recommend.

#### AP/Test Prep

1. [Albert](https://www.albert.io/subjects/high-school/ap)

Albert is absolutely brilliant for test prep. There are immensely thorough practice tests for basically every subject. I highly recommend trying out Albert.

1. [Khan Academy](https://blog.khanacademy.org/khan-academy-is-the-official-practice-partner-for/)

I’m sure y’all’d’ve already heard and used Khan Academy before, but I still find it a useful resource for basic content practice. (Check out [Austin Scholar #13: The Pros and Cons of Khan Academy](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-13-the-pros-and-cons) for a more in-depth analysis of the app.)

1. [AP Review](https://www.apreviewbook.com/)
2. Use the internet!

There are so many great resources out there to help with test prep, and just studying in general. Find what works best for you.

1. Just start studying and practicing now. You’ll have less work later.

#### College Prep

Since it’s my junior year, I’ve been spending **a lot** of time watching college prep videos on YouTube, and I think I’ve found two of the most valuable ones:

1. [19 College Application Tips (YouTube video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUc0C19jtuE)
2. [College Application 101 (YouTube video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EN1xpv6TM0)
3. [Austin Scholar #26: Three Ways To Get Your Kid Ready For The School Year](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-26-three-ways-to-get)

In the Scholar’s Sources of my latest newsletter, I found four super helpful college planning websites that have helped me decide what I need to focus on this year.

#### Motivation

1. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)

There are so many motivational videos on YouTube, so one of them *has* to work for you. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj7fgZQCe0M) on Kobe Bryant’s work ethic is literally one of my favorite videos to rewatch. Extremely powerful and motivational.

1. [i am Widget](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/i-am-daily-affirmations/id874656917)

This is such a beautiful app to have because it sends you little affirmations and motivational words throughout the day. Each notification will bring a smile to your face and can encourage you to keep going :)

1. Purchase a nice notebook (or a vision board, or something else that feels deliberate and like an investment)

and write down your goals. Revisit it on a weekly basis and remind yourself what you're working towards.

#### Calming Atmosphere

Having a really good coffee shop or bookstore to study at can completely change your focus levels. Separating relaxation and work is super important. (I love [Juan Pelota](https://www.austintexas.org/listings/juan-pelota-cafe/9520/) and [BookPeople](https://www.bookpeople.com/).)

#### Stationery

Get stationery that makes you happy AND helps you stay productive. I use [a really good pen](https://us-shop.lamy.com/en_us/fountain-pen-lamy-al-star.html#nib_grade=7221&nib_material=7228), [random mechanical pencils](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Bic-24-3-Bonus-Mechanical-Pencil-0-7mm/111743529?wl13=1253&selectedSellerId=0), [a scratch paper notebook](https://www.target.com/p/spiral-notebook-1-subject-college-ruled-mod-daisy-black-five-star/-/A-81626604#lnk=sametab), [a nice notebook](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/ABOUT-BLANKS-BLACKWELLS-EDITION-by-ABOUT-BLANKS/2100000252763), and [an amazing binder](https://www.target.com/p/five-star-9-pocket-expanding-file-and-folder-tidewater-teal/-/A-84147245#lnk=sametab).

#### Twitter

I’m not going to lie: I wasn’t a super Twitter believer. I always associated Twitter with random “How to start a business when you’re in high school” threads that my dad would send me. But, wow, I’ve never been so happy to be wrong.

Twitter has completely changed my life. There is absolutely endless extremely valuable content on the platform, especially for high schoolers: study tips, time management, goal setting, writing hacks, and in general “How to get your life together” advice. I highly recommend that you include Twitter in your routine.
