### **Hey, y'all!**

No matter how much you think you know about mental health, and how good you think your habits are, it's an important thing to stay on top of.

Having good mental hygiene habits can make you wildly successful–and having poor mental hygiene habits can make you fall flat on your face.

Like I experienced this week. Oops?

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: My own reminder of why mental health is so important
2. Five logical reasons why mental health needs to come first
3. Scholar’s Sources: My favorite videos on managing stress and staying productive

This week, my best friend [P and I](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-24-the-science-of) did a ton of feedback sessions with students from our Write of Passage: Liftoff [focus group sessions](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-28-the-college-process), and they were so insanely cool. We got to hear what *actual people* thought about the exercises and sessions that we made?! Absolutely insane.

From these sessions, we’ve gotten a ton of really great feedback about how we can improve [Liftoff](https://ckarchive.com/b/qdu8h7h74d6pr?utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Friday+Finds+%28Beauty%2C+CEO%2C+Greeks%2C+Novels%2C+Culture%29%20-%208754440) and take high school writing to the next level. Stay tuned for more updates on Liftoff–it’s going to be great.

### Austin’s Anecdote: My Own Reminder Of Why Mental Health Is So Important

I’m not going to lie: this week, I wasn’t on track to finish this newsletter on time.

This past Tuesday was quite possibly in the top ten most stressful days of my life. I had Liftoff meetings all day, a German lesson, a meeting with my academic coach (more on coaching in a future newsletter!), ridiculous amounts of [app work](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-18-do-educational) to do, my final [Alpha Bootcamp](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-28-the-incomplete) checklist items, and a ton of Twitter DMs and emails to respond to.

I was pretty overwhelmed. But I had to push forward.

All day, there was intense nervous energy coursing through my body. My hands couldn’t stop shaking. I felt like I  was in a constant “fight-or-flight” state, tensed in anticipation and dread.

A sensible person might realize that going about my day in this state was *extraordinarily* unhealthy, but I was so caught up in my task list that I just ignored these red flags.

At 11:30 PM (I hadn’t stopped since 9:00 AM), when I finally checked off the last thing on my checklist, I shut my computer and staggered to my bed, the adrenaline of the day wearing off.

Once I was laying in my bed with nothing to distract me from myself, I started to feel… pretty bad.

My stomach started unbearably hurting and I was sweating and my head was pounding. The shaking in my hands reached another level as my body tried to release the excess anxiety from the day.

I was horribly, physically sick.

The next morning, after a long and restless night, my mom came into my room to check on me, took one look at me, and told me to stay home.

Too delusional and tired to argue, I fell back to sleep.

In the afternoon, once I woke up again and could think coherently, I realized how incredibly stupid I had been.

I was so stressed that I made myself sick. I ignored all of the warnings my body had given me and just kept working.

Not my brightest moment.

And because I was now sick, I had to stay home for the entire day and **couldn’t** do any school work at all.

In my quest to do all of my work on Tuesday, I set myself up for failure for the rest of the week.

And so, after giving myself ten minutes to wallow in my self-pity, I grabbed by iPad and started watching [Project Runway](https://www.bravotv.com/project-runway).

No work was getting done that day, so I took the time to reset and honor my body and my limits.

I’ve been really, *really* good about managing my stress levels and workload over the past year, but I’m still not perfect.

I’ve written about [managing school stress](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-12-managing-may) and [discussed my own mental health journey and how to help teenagers with their mental health](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-15-even-if-its-not), but even I need some serious reminders sometimes of why putting my mental health first is the most important decision in the entire world.

And, while it was unfortunate, this week reminded me of that.

So, because of my little *fiasco*, I’m only getting started on this week’s newsletter–and it’s already Friday. Oops?

But it seems clear that mental health is an appropriate topic to revisit this week.

### Five Logical Reasons Why Mental Health Needs To Come First

My adventure this week isn’t an experience unique to me. Most high schoolers deal with these things, and it’s a problem. Because of that, I’ve compiled a list of five reasons why mental health needs to come before anything else in a high schooler’s life.

1. Stress takes up brainpower

When your teen is stressed about something, they are giving it valuable space in their brain that could otherwise be used for their schoolwork, their passion projects–or, you know, enjoying life.

I know that when I’m stressed and completely overwhelmed, a *ton*of time is wasted thinking about how stressed I am and how much work I have to do.

On the other hand, when I have a challenging, yet super manageable to-do list, I’m much more productive and efficient because I’m not distracted by my anxious thoughts.

I promise: 1 hour of intense work when I’m not crazy-stressed is infinitely more productive than 3 hours of work when I’m crazy-stressed.

Encourage your teen to create a simple, yet effective system to organize their assignments and prioritize their to-dos.

I recently started using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to organize my day-to-day life and prioritize my tasks.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o8Oo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aec8974-b9e1-4649-bdfc-0ff2af066732_1226x438.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o8Oo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aec8974-b9e1-4649-bdfc-0ff2af066732_1226x438.png)

I organize my assignments in a way that makes the most sense to me, so that when I make my to-do list, it’s easy to see what needs to be done that day and what can wait until tomorrow.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b0WJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e588b99-cb08-4d59-81ec-4aea6f69f2a1_404x374.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b0WJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e588b99-cb08-4d59-81ec-4aea6f69f2a1_404x374.png)

Using these systems allows me to create habits that minimize the amount of stress and brainpower I waste asking myself: “should I do work?”

2. Getting more sleep is directly proportional to productivity and quality of life

One of the most important aspects of improving mental health is getting more sleep. Besides all of the negative mood-altering effects of a lack of sleep, getting enough sleep increases perception, memory, and thinking speed, which will increase productivity while working.

And increased productivity means getting things done more efficiently and at a higher quality, which can lead to getting better grades in less time.

This then leads to having more free time to work on passion projects and hang with loved ones.

All of this–more sleep, increased productivity, and more free time–all contribute to having a higher quality of life and more feelings of satisfaction and contentment.

Doesn’t that sound like a dream?

Well, it all starts with getting more sleep.

Try telling your teen to prioritize getting 9 hours of sleep every night, and watch as their productivity and connection skyrocket.

(Read [Austin Scholar #10: Let Teenagers Take Naps](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-10-let-teenagers-take) for more on the benefits of sleeping.)

3. Burnout takes up time

Academic burnout affects more than [half of the students in America](https://www.maristcircle.com/citynational-news/2021/12/4/burnout-increases-among-college-students).

Symptoms include feelings of exhaustion, anxiety, and hopelessness, and finding academic work incredibly overwhelming.

Academic burnout isn’t some small thing. It builds up through increased stress over long periods of time, culminating in serious exhaustion and a lack of motivation.

This isn’t easy stuff to work past.

Healing burnout can take weeks of revitalization to reignite your inner drive.

Because of absurd academic and social pressures, more than half of students experience this–which means there’s more than a 50% chance your kid will experience it at some point

Instead of pushing and cramming and stressing for half of the year, then burning out and being unable to do any work for the next half, tell your kid to prioritize mental health from the beginning.

4. Learning is supposed to be fun

The truest tragedy of school is that it takes away students’ love of learning.

Making learning *stressful* might be the thing that has most hindered innovation and progress.

By only associating learning with negative emotions (intense anxiety, frustration, hopelessness, etc.), students are discouraged from exploring their interests and making connections and discovering new things. Imagine how many kids would’ve grown up to be innovators if that love wasn’t crushed?

With positive mental health, though, high schoolers won’t be as consumed with these negative emotions all of the time. Instead, while they’re learning, feelings such as motivation and excitement and passion can emerge.

Imagine what would be possible if an entire generation of kids loved to learn.

5. Better mental health leads to higher ambitions

When your mental health suffers, it leads to an incredibly negative outlook on life.

A negative outlook on life leads to a hopeless and negative thought process on personal abilities and dreams.

With this comes a lack of ambition and belief in your ability to achieve your goals.

Which naturally leads to students not being able to reach their full potential.

Hope is such a crucial piece of ambition and reaching goals, yet a hallmark of poor mental health is hopelessness.

Give your kid the chance to have hope. Let them believe they can do crazy things.

Encourage them to be [mindful](https://www.realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/breathing-exercises), stay grounded, and be content with themselves.

These things take time and practice, but the results they lead to make them totally worth the effort.

### Scholar’s Sources: My Favorite Videos On Managing Stress And Staying Productive

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh5HyJ1rxzk) is a super short, but value-packed animated YouTube video that goes into a ton of practical tips for managing stress. There are great tips for creating your schedule, explanations on the importance of building a support network, and reasons to give yourself a break. This is a great video to send to your kids–mostly because it won’t take them that long to watch, but they’ll still get a ton of high-quality information.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk2-dKH2Ta4) seriously might be the best video on managing stress out there. The video has *so many* really actionable and reasonable tips on how to manage stress. It starts off with the science behind stress and how it can affect your life, before diving into foundational ways to minimize stress, then closing with targeted tips. This video has a lot of really complex concepts that are broken down into easy-to-understand action items for students. I HIGHLY recommend watching this video.

I really love [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irp5ghCVNAM) on procrastination because it provides seven really clear and actionable tips to cure procrastination, all based on a math equation!! I love the logic of math, and applying it to procrastination is so incredibly brilliant.

Motivation = (Expectancy \* Value) / (Impulsiveness \* Delay)

The video breaks down each part of this equation and describes how to use the equation to maximize motivation and decrease procrastination. Procrastination can lead to a TON of stress for high schoolers, so teaching them how to hack their procrastination is incredibly valuable.
