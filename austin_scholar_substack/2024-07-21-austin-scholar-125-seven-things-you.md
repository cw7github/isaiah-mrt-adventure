### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Seven things you can do to get your kid to read
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

This past Tuesday and Wednesday were very important days for any college student: Amazon Prime Day!! My mom and I spent Tuesday morning frantically scouring Amazon for the best deals on college supplies. I’ll write a future newsletter about what all I’m bringing to college, but here’s a preview of some things I bought during Prime Day:

* A mattress topper (EVERY SINGLE TikTok video about what to bring to college starts with the mattress topper necessity)
* An air purifier (usually item two – no one likes getting sick)
* Cute desk organizers for my makeup and jewelry (I want to love my room – I’m going to work as hard as I can this summer to curate the perfect selection of items to make my dorm seem like a home)

I was able to get most of my utilities and basics during Prime Day, but now it’s time for the fun part: decorations!!

### Seven things you can do to get your kid to read

Two years ago, I wrote an article about [how to get your kid to read over the summer](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-20-three-rules-for), but I got a comment from one of my readers that they didn’t feel like the article had super clear action items, so I’m hoping to rectify that with this article. Here is the (updated) how to get your kid to *actually* read:

1. **The “you can stay up as late as you want as long as you’re reading” rule**

Love, love, love this rule. For as long as I can remember, my parents have told me that I could stay up as late as I wanted, as long as I was reading (and as long as I didn’t complain about being tired the next day). This made reading feel like a sneaky reward…exhilarating, almost. Of course, there can be exceptions for this rule (if they have a test the next day, if they’ve been staying up too late reading too much, if they have a game the next day, etc.) but if your kid has an early morning activity, they're likely to self-regulate this part.

2. **Start a family book club**

Reading together is the best accountability and encouragement system. At the beginning of the month (or week – however long you want) go to a bookstore and pick a book together. Make sure it’s a book your kid is excited about. Spend time reading together every few days and make sure to have discussions about each chapter and character. When you both finish the book, have a fun night where you order pizza and ice cream and talk about your final thoughts on the book. This not only associates reading with a reward, but it also shows your kid that you’re as involved in this reading thing as they are.

3. **Spend time in libraries and bookstores**

Just go to a bookstore or library!! Make it an outing and spend an afternoon walking through the shelves and reading together. Get a sweet treat after. Get a book to take home. I promise, you’ll be surprised at how much just being around that many books for a few hours changes things. It’s, like, osmosis or something :)

4. **Encourage them to read books with their friends**

This is what I’ve been doing recently. If I’m watching an interesting movie or show with my friends that is based on a book, we’ll go to BookPeople together and start reading. My conversations about these books have been some of the most memorable of my high school journey (whether it’s screaming about Leto II’s hilarious manipulation in God Emperor of Dune or arguing about Conrad from The Summer I Turned Pretty – I think he’s trash but my best friend loves him). Just get them reading with their friends and their friendship will do the rest. To do this, you could suggest reading the book together to compare it with the movie, bribe them with a fun pizza, ice cream, and watching the book’s movie or show night, or just buy the two of them the book to read (the friend will usually feel guilty if they don’t read it, so they probably will – I know I always read any book I’ve been gifted).

Now, if you want your kid to start improving their reading abilities and broaden their genres, you need to start implementing core knowledge into their daily reading.

Let me explain.

Alpha’s reading app (AlphaRead) used to be pretty much exclusively based on fun, random articles that kids answer questions about.

We realized that we were kind of wasting their time – yes, they were improving their reading comprehension skills with these articles, but we could do better, help kids spend their time more efficiently.

Especially when it comes to preparing them for tests. The passages in exams like the SAT or STAAR tests were significantly more informative or of ‘literary merit’ than the content they were consuming in the app. The passages were based on [core knowledge topics](https://www.coreknowledge.org/our-approach/#:~:text=The%20Core%20Knowledge%20Sequence%20is,from%20preschool%20through%20grade%20eight.) (“recommended content knowledge and skills to be taught in language arts, history and geography, visual arts, music, mathematics, and science from preschool through grade eight.” – from the Core Knowledge Foundation)

So this year, AlphaRead will have articles about core knowledge topics, so students can learn *while* they improve their reading comprehension skills. They can read articles about history, science, language arts… whatever courses or grades they’re in.

The goal is to multi-task, in a sense. Learn about your core knowledge topics and use reading comprehension skills in the same 25-minute session so you’re more prepared for your other courses.

So how can you implement it for your kid? *You* as the parent have to be a part of it.

Kids aren’t going to automatically start reading informational articles without some motivation – and a connection with you is the best way to start.

1. **Send them articles**

This is my dad’s favorite thing to do. He sends me multiple articles per day about education, college, newsletter writing, and, of course, baseball. Not only are the articles interesting, but I know he’s going to ask me about them at the end of the day, so I always try to really understand each one. But he also makes sure to make it like a conversation, not a quiz. Instead of just answering questions about the article, we discuss the main ideas and how they interact with things going on in the rest of the world. Also, it makes me feel happy that my dad’s thinking about me throughout his day :)

2. **Have dinner discussions**

To make it a more formal affair, you could pick one day per week to be a “theme night.” At the beginning of the day, you all  pick a topic or article (your “theme”). Throughout the day, everyone participating (ideally the whole family) independently reads about the topic and comes up with at least two questions to discuss during dinner. An important thing here – the more your kid is involved in the process, the more they’ll actually enjoy this event. Let them pick the topic. Have them present first. Let their thoughts be heard before yours.

3. **Really dive into some of their interests**

If you know your kid is really interested in football or history or painting, spend some time researching the topic they love and sending them the best articles about it. Not only will they actually enjoy reading the articles, but they’ll feel seen and loved by you.

ACTION ITEMS FOR A PARENT:

1. Implement the “you can stay up as late as you want as long as you’re reading” rule
2. Start a family book club
3. Go to bookstores and libraries (osmosis!)
4. Tell them to read books with their friends (bribery or playing on their friend’s guilt if necessary)
5. Send them articles and talk about them at the end of the day
6. Start doing dinner “theme nights”
7. Research their interests and send them articles about them

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [Science is Poisoning You – Rousseau’s First Discourse Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8ucJ29O1kM)

One thing my family absolutely loves to dive into is philosophical and historical concepts – and Johnathan Bi’s exploration into Rousseau’s First Discourse definitely fits in. I found the discussion to present an interesting dichotomy in my mind – I agreed with many of the base effects of growth and science, but I don’t necessarily agree with the conclusion. I also don’t believe that life was better hundreds of years ago – I wouldn’t even want to go back to the 20th century and live without my iPhone.

2. [Two Weeks in Zimbabwe](https://peytonprice.substack.com/p/my-two-weeks-in-victoria-falls-zimbabwe)

I am so beyond proud of my best friend Peyton – she’s spent the last two weeks on a mission trip in Zimbabwe. Before the trip, she raised *thousands* of dollars to support it and wrote a beautiful testimony and woke up at, like, 4:30 am while we were in Japan together for her preparation calls. She’s put so much time and energy into even going on this trip, so when I was able to read about how she’s put it all together, I almost cried. Her article highlights the differences in American and African kids’ outlooks and receptiveness – definitely an interesting contrast. She also describes the beauty of Zimbabwe while showcasing how lucky we are to live in the US. I *highly* recommend you check out this article and support Peyton on her journey!!

3. [The New Mystery Pitch That’s Driving MLB Hitters Crazy](https://www.wsj.com/sports/baseball/paul-skenes-mlb-all-star-game-ab914d8a?st=yf9188mjffqexqd&reflink=article_imessage_share)

The MLB All-Star game was last Tuesday, and I was lucky enough to see Paul Skenes’ incredible splinker pitch in-person. Even though Skenes only pitched for one inning, it’s beyond clear that he’s a brilliant pitcher. I might have to turn on a Pirates game every once in a while :) One thing I particularly loved about this article is that it described how simple mistakes can lead to revolutionary discoveries – you just have to recognize them.
