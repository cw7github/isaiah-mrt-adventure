### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: The biggest wins and losses of my junior year
2. Takeaways from my junior year (and how they can help your kid)
3. Scholar’s Sources: My growth this year, showcased in newsletter form

For my first week off from school, I spent this time in Dallas watching some incredible baseball games with my dad. Every minute was exciting, from three people getting ejected in one game (for non-baseball people, that’s super rare), to game-changing missed calls, to [Shohei Otanhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani) pitching a great game and hitting a home run to secure the win. I’m so glad I got to share this time with my dad–as I've written about before, doing meaningful things with your parents as a teenager is so helpful for your relationship.

Happy Father’s Day to the most supportive dad in the world.

### Austin’s Anecdote: The biggest wins and losses of my junior year

I can’t believe my junior year is (already? finally?) over. It was a big one.

This year was filled with some fantastic wins, and also some hard losses.

A lot of the highlights were a mix of both:

* I met my goal of getting a 1500+ on the SAT, but my score isn’t Ivy-level yet
* I gained 6,500 Twitter followers, but I failed [my Rocketship goal](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-50-how-to-motivate) of 10,000
* I reached 1,000 newsletter followers, but am still eons away from my [Masterpiece goal](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-1-what-school-do-you)

Wins and losses aside, my junior year was clearly one of growth–in all areas of my life.

Perhaps most visibly, I’ve grown more fearless. I’ve learned to actually reach out to people I admire for support and advice. I’m more willing than ever to share my innermost thoughts–and my failures–on the internet. I will take the jump to achieve my goals, even when it scares me.

I’ve also really learned how to fail, and how to take feedback to improve. There have been so many days where I didn’t meet my goals, and so many projects that didn’t go as planned. [Alpha](http://alpha.school) is a hard school. I’m definitely not the perfect student–although I realize no high schooler really is. l think I truly understood that this year.

As I prepare to go to college and live on my own, I feel as though I have a more thorough understanding of the world, and of the skills I need to master to thrive in it. I’ve learned finance stuff, actually applying to college stuff, and living on my own stuff. I’m defnitely not ready to move out tomorrow, but I can feel myself preparing, and when I reflect on how much I’ve grown this year, it makes me excited to see what growth next year (my senior year?!) will hold.

### Takeaways from my junior year (and how they can help your kid)

Let’s get back to those losses (because you know me: I like getting things right). Looking back, there are definitely some things I could’ve done differently to actually achieve my goals.

There are three main areas in which I would’ve liked to have done better: studying for the SAT, growing on Twitter, and growing my newsletter. I’ve done some deep reflection on each of these areas, and have some advice for your kids so they can get it right the first time.

**How to improve an SAT score**

For the SAT, I personally wish I had focused much more on true practice tests and targeted learning from the beginning.

Taking practice tests is the best way to prepare for the actual test, so make sure to take as many as possible. And, instead of *just taking* practice tests, your kid should thoroughly review every practice test they take. Go over every missed question to identify gaps in timing, content knowledge, and question-answering strategies.

The practice tests reveal the types of questions that will appear on the actual SAT, so it’s super important for your kid to utilize that insight and modify their study approach accordingly.

In addition to official SAT practice tests, make sure to tell them to use targeted resources like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and [IXL](https://www.ixl.com/) to focus their studying on identified weaknesses and improve specific skills.

Study with friends whenever possible for added accountability, motivation, and overall enjoyment in studying.

**How to grow on Twitter and Substack (and how I will continue to do so)**

My plans for achieving each of these goals are very similar, so I thought I’d group them for simplicity.

When your teen wants to grow a platform like Twitter or start a newsletter, the first piece of advice I have is to ensure they have a clear purpose. Having a strong reason will motivate them through the challenges that arise. Encourage them to think about why they want to post content in the first place, and have them define their niche or 'personal monopoly' that makes them stand out. Make sure they can answer these questions: Why should someone follow me? What makes my content special? What insights can I provide that no one else can?

Consistency on Twitter was something I really struggled with. I’m a perfectionist, so posting something when it hadn’t been through fifty rounds of edits definitely scared me. Even now, posting daily on Twitter (which is a necessity–I’ve seen a significant decrease in my impressions if I miss just one day) can be horrible.

If your kid is like me and consistency is a struggle, be ready to cheer them on through the ups and downs. Encourage them to post daily on Twitter and weekly on Substack. On the weeks where nothing seems to be working, remind them of their end goal. It will seem hopeless at times, but it’s helpful to focus on the long game.

Learning to send cold emails was the biggest game-changer. So many new opportunities emerged and I met my heroes. I’ve talked with Sahil Bloom, Steven Strogatz, and Ana Lorena Fabrega–all through cold DMs. Reaching out to my heroes allowed me to grow my audience to what it is today, and is what I will continue to do to reach my goal. If they want to build an audience, your teen will need to promote their content. Sharing first with close friends and family is a great start, but as your kid gains confidence, they need to learn how to cold email.

Generative AI has [transformed writing](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-48-how-to-teach-kids). So much of the stress of writing consistently is alleviated because of these tools. I’ve been able to use GPT as a full-time newsletter editor, copywriter for Twitter, and a platform growth expert. It is an absolute necessity for your teen to learn to use AI tools to help them create the best, highest-quality content possible.

The biggest things I wish I’d prioritized from the beginning: proper practice, a focused niche, consistency and persistence, and strategic promotion. With targeted preparation and a clear sense of purpose, students can vastly increase their chances of achieving goals like improving their SAT score or building an audience–the first time around.

And with proper planning and a solid strategy in place, the overall experience becomes more straightforward and enjoyable, with failures serving primarily as opportunities to course-correct and improve the approach.

Learning from mistakes—your own and those of others—can help future endeavors go right the first time.
