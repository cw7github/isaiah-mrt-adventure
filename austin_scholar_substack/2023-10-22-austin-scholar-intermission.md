### **Hey, y'all!**

As you know, I’ve been in the throes of writing my college application personal statement. I am now on my seventh attempt. Yeah… it’s not going amazingly.

I really want to get the statement locked down this week, so unfortunately I don’t have a newsletter for you guys.

Please wish me luck and I’ll see you next week.

Thank you for understanding,

Austin
