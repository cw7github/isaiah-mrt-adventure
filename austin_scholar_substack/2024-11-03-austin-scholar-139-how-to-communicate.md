### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: The stereotypes of teenagers
2. How to communicate with your kids without getting one word answers
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

What a week I’ve had.

Over this past weekend, I went to a multitude of sports events that, while exciting and fun, left me pretty behind for this week, so I had a pretty chaotic Monday and Tuesday catching up.

On that – I completely lost my voice Sunday afternoon and on Monday, I still could only croak out a few words at a time. Normally, this wouldn’t be *that* big of a deal, but, of course, with college, nothing’s ever that simple. On Monday, I had an in-class debate in which I wrote the introduction to our opening statement and would be required to speak for five minutes straight. And it’s worth 20% of my grade. Yikes. I did the best I could, though (I had, like, ten cough drops leading up to it), and hope I didn’t let down my partners too much.

On a positive note, though, at the figure skating event and hockey game on Friday, I got my figure skating team jacket!! I feel very cool wearing it :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: The stereotypes of teenagers

Possibly the biggest stereotype of all time is the moody, petty teenagers who don’t talk to their parents.

In almost every TV show that features a teenager, they’re pictured to give one word answers when their parents ask them about their days and roll their eyes in every other sentence.

I’m sad to report that there was a time in my life in which I did the same. I couldn’t find the words to describe my days, and I was often so exhausted at the end of school that the very last thing I wanted to do was talk about it.

Because we didn’t have meaningful daily check-ins or updates, my parents and I grew to be kind of disconnected from one another, which in turn made it hard to communicate clearly.

My parents did want to connect, though, but they weren’t asking me the right questions, so I wasn’t giving them good answers.

Eventually, though, I talked to them about how I felt. I told them about the frustrations I had with the questions they would ask me and we found ways to work it out.

Now that I’m in college, I call my parents every single evening to tell them about every single detail of my day.

This reversal wasn’t easy, but it can be done.

### Here’s how to communicate with your kids without getting one word answers

This whole article is based on a question I received after my previous newsletter. The whole idea of one-word answers immediately brought me back to seventh grade, when I wrote a full essay ranting about why I hate the questions “how was your day” and “how are you doing.”

Literally a full essay. Over 1,000 words. Titled, “Things I don’t tell my parents,” as a reference to the fact that I didn’t tell them the truth about my day or how I was feeling when they asked me those questions.

I thought about just sending you that, but I've matured in my thinking since then, so I decided to rewrite it – you're welcome.

I believe there are two key concepts when you want to communicate and connect with your kid after they get home from school:

1. Be specific
2. Listen

I’ll illustrate these concepts by bringing us back to the same question I raged against in seventh grade:

“*How was your day?*”

When asked a question as broad as this, it allows teenagers to act upon their still-developing brains’ tendencies toward black and white thinking.

It’s easy to default to a “good,” “fine,” or “bad” answer because most teenagers aren’t developed enough to show nuance in their descriptions.

If my parents asked me about my day now, I would probably talk about how I was stressed running late this morning, but I had a great break between two of my classes and walked to the Stanford Marketplace with a friend and was able to get back on top of things.

But if my parents asked me about my day when I was fourteen, I would say “fine.” Because the morning was bad but the rest of the day was good, so if you average those out it’s “fine.”

This is where specificity and listening to your kid come in.

If the day before, your kid mentioned being annoyed at their group project partners for not doing their share of the work, ask them about that specific part of their day. If your kid is struggling with one of their teachers, approach a conversation like another teenager eagerly awaiting the “tea” on the day’s happenings.

Those specific questions can’t be answered with a “fine.” And, since they’ll realize that you listened to their previous ramblings, they will likely be inclined to talk to you more.

On that note, asking about specific tests or homework grades right after school can make your kid feel like that’s your number one priority – that their test scores are the most significant part of who they are as a student. And if they didn’t do well (which, if they didn’t immediately mention their scores, that could be likely), they could feel like you’re judging them. Since the conversation will probably taper off anyway after their reveal of their score (or delve into more serious topics like studying and grades), your kid could feel like it’s always negative to talk to you about school. This pattern makes it really easy for kids to not like to talk to you about their school life and can separate the two of you from each other.

So ask them a few other questions first, and *then* you can bring up the test or homework or essay. And if your kid didn’t do well, sit down with them and work together to come up with a plan to move forward. When they’re younger, this is definitely necessary so they can learn how to learn from a not-so-great grade, but as they get older, you can just ask them if they’ve made a plan and move on from there.

If you’re still not completely sure what to ask your kid about instead of those two questions, here are a few templates you can use:

* I know you’ve been annoyed with your teacher in X class, how did they act today?
* I know you’ve been enjoying X class, what did you do in that class today?
* You’ve talked to me about X problem with your friend, were you able to resolve it?
* Did your project partners put in any work yet?
* Are there any concepts you’re learning about in X class that I can help out with?
* What did you do during your lunch break today? Was the cafeteria food as bad as yesterday?

One additional important thing to note: school and extracurriculars and social drama and college applications work can often be super overwhelming and sometimes, your kid just won’t want to talk to you, no matter how good your questions are. And that’s okay.

You just have to let them know that you’re there for them. I probably wouldn’t recommend mentioning their lack of communication or to continue pushing for answers – they might feel cornered or judged. Instead, say something like “I’d love to watch one episode of our favorite TV show while we eat dinner, would you want to do that?” or something similar so you can still spend time together, even if you don’t talk.

I also like the idea of including these plans in a task they’re already going to be doing. Your kid might feel too stressed or have too much homework to want to add watching an episode of a TV show into their routine, so doing that together while eating dinner will likely feel like less of a lift. What’s more, it will also force them to eat *with* you, instead of lugging their meal to their room or eating at a later time.

My view of a lot of this is that communicating with your kid and building a strong bond is not easy.

You have to be willing to put in the work – don’t just take the easy way out and ask “how was your day” and shrug it off with a “well I tried” when you get the answer “fine.”

Being a good parent and fostering a good relationship with your kid takes work. Make sure you’re putting it in.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [The Dissident Teacher](https://x.com/educatedandfree/status/1850326964286144688?s=42)

An hour before y’all received last week’s newsletter, I received this article in my inbox from my dad with the title, “Lots of incriminating content.” I, of course, immediately clicked on the article and just about died of shock that my dad had sent me an article that perfectly fits the theme of the newsletter that was going to be sent out in less than an hour!! He’s a mind-reader, I swear.

Anyway, since I didn’t have time to fit this article in last week’s newsletter, I thought I’d include it here.

Some troubling information from this article:

“The writing of 9th-12th graders in English was often incoherent, full of fragment sentences and errors in English grammar, usage, and mechanics. Students couldn’t seem to organize their thoughts meaningfully and employed little vocabulary beyond the 6th grade level.”

**Students can’t read or write.**

“Every AP Econ class I taught at that school audibly gasped when told calculators weren’t allowed on Econ tests, which at most require knowledge of basic arithmetic…One of the hardest-working seniors in my class last year, a 17-year-old from a wealthy, supportive family, needed help multiplying two-digit numbers; he wasn’t sure what to do with carried numbers.”

**Students can’t do math**.

And the grand conclusion: “By claiming to educate your child, public school is defrauding your family.”

I highly recommend reading the rest of this article if you want to learn more :)

2. Quotes from Andre Agassi

A few weeks ago, Andre Agassi came to speak about his book, *Open*, at Stanford. Here were some of my favorite things he said:

“You make decisions and are motivated by one of two things: fear or love.”

“Just because you don’t choose your life doesn’t mean you can’t take ownership over it.”

“The space between the mind and heart can be the greatest distance on Earth.”

“Often, the only way out is to succeed.”

“Parents focus so much on giving their kids what they never had that they sometimes forget to give them what they did have.”

“My objective [for my school] was to prove that we fail kids, they don’t fail us.”

“Transformation is change from one thing to another, but I started as nothing. I didn't transform, I formed.”

After the talk, I did some additional research and found [this article](https://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2018/01/11/while_telling_his_life_story_andre_agassi_teaches_basic_economics_103083.html), which I really enjoyed and recommend that you check out if you want to teach economics to your tennis-loving kid.

3. [Football 4 First Timers](https://www.tiktok.com/@askkait/video/7266867898843450666?_t=8qvqGAgWHtu&_r=1)

Despite the fact that I live across the street from UT, I never really paid attention to football. But now that I’m at Stanford and that people know I’m *from* Austin, TX, I’ve had to get really good at *pretending* to have paid attention to football for the last 18 years of my life. So, I turned to TikTok, as one does when in need of accurate information.

It turns out, one of my favorite baseball accounts (she does great reviews of games, even though she’s a Yankee fan :/) also made a series about football!! I’ve watched the entire series (a few times) and feel, at least, like I understand what’s going on when watching Stanford lose 7-49.

So dads: if you want your daughter (or non-football fan son) to watch some games with you, send them this series!! You could do something where you send one video from the series per day and talk about it at dinner – anything to get more connection with your kid :)
