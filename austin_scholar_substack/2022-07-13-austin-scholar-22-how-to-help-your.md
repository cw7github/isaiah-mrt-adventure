### **Hey, y'all!**

I like to think I've started to master the art of having a great summer break. Summer is supposed to be a time for all the things you can't do during the school year: working on passion projects, traveling to new places, and binge-watching your favorite shows. Or, if you’re like my mom, a few “summer shenanigans” are a must.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote:  Last summer’s last-minute plans
2. How to help your kid find value in their summer
3. Scholar’s Sources: A few Masterclasses I'd love to delve into this summer

This has been, well, quite a week. Last Thursday, my mom and I spent the. entire. day. at the DPS so I could get my driver’s permit. And then I didn’t get it.

I cannot even begin to express my frustration with the DPS in this newsletter. Is there no way to make the system more efficient? Or, how about this: make sure that each employee believes the same documents are required for getting a permit.

We saw a few different people, and each one told us different things.

“You just need your immunization record and then you’re good,” said the first guy.

“No, obviously, you don’t need your immunization record. I don’t know why he told you that. But you need these five other documents,” said the second woman.

I’m done.

Anyways, I’ll have an update in August about my permit!

Also, at the end of this newsletter is a short motivational letter to the teens, so watch out for that.

### **Austin's Anecdote: Last Summer’s Last-Minute Plans**

At the end of my freshman year of high school (last year), I had no plans for the summer.

I had thoughts about watching a few movies with my dad, maybe going on a few walks, and maybe reading a book.

Basically, I didn’t have anything valuable to do during the summer. I was ready for a normal, kind of boring few months.

But then, my best friend started to tell me about her summer plans.

She was going to Colorado for a few weeks, then to a fancy law program in Boston, then to a camp with her cousin. While she was talking about all of the cool things she was doing that summer, I started to get a little worried (read: totally jealous) about my plans, which were nonexistent. I had an urge to actually get some value out of my two months of free time.

And so, the second I got home, I started looking up “summer programs for high schoolers,” and “baseball games in Texas in July.”

I was cutting it a little close: I had, like, two weeks until I got out of school.

Anyways, it was during this Google session that I found the [Putney Student Travel Programs](https://goputney.com/) (read [Austin Scholar #11: Finding Your Tribe](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-11-finding-your-tribe) to learn about my experience with PST) where applications were already closed. The only reason I got in was because a lot of people canceled due to COVID. I also organized a trip to Dallas for 10 days to watch 10 baseball games less than two weeks before we left.

Yeah, I definitely should’ve started planning sooner.

But, a few late nights and a lot of awkward phone calls later, I actually had summer plans!

The important part of these haphazard plans, though, was the value that each of these trips held for me.

Watching baseball with my dad is our favorite thing to do together, and getting to go on the PST trip made me so happy because I had a chance to be independent and to spend all of my time writing.

While I’m sure that I would’ve had a nice summer if I didn’t make all of these plans, it was a much better summer because of them.

### **How To Help Your Kid Find Value In Their Summer**

Last summer I was lost. I was fully prepared to settle for a quiet summer. If your teen is struggling to have a productive summer, here are a few things you can try. (Even if your teen is already busy this summer, some of these ideas might be useful for them too.)

The core idea of building a valuable summer is recognizing the importance of the break from school and all of the opportunities it provides. During these two months, encourage your teen to explore, try new things, and experiment – before they're bogged down with school and responsibilities again.

*Okay, Austin, but what should I do next?*

Well, the best place to start is to simply have a conversation with your kid.

And I mean a *conversation*. Where both people contribute and respond to each other.

Do *not* (I cannot stress this enough) lecture your kid for an hour about how they are wasting their time and need to get a job and be productive if they want to be successful in life.

The goal of the conversation is to discuss possible opportunities together about where they can find value in their summer. A lecture would just turn your teen off and would set off a series of "It's fine"s and "I don't care"s and no real ideas would flow.

*What should the conversation entail,* you might ask?

Here are the five categories you can discuss with your teen to help them bring value to their summer.

1. Teenager Things

First off: making sure that your teen is spending some time hanging out with their friends, binging TV shows, going to concerts, or just doing normal teenager things (safely, of course) is important. They need to have these experiences in order to grow.

And yes, sometimes that growth comes from making mistakes. That’s important too.

Let your kid pull an all-nighter with their friends or watch TV all day or use shoe polish to vandalize their neighbor's driveway (I'm looking at you, mom).

(Yes, she really did that once.)

Let them live and let them be dumb teenagers.

1. Family Time

I won't lie: a lot of times it can be hard to convince teens of the importance of family. It's not because they don't love you, it's just that they long for independence. Making time in the summer to connect as a family can really help to strengthen bonds and make them last through the stress and social pressures of the school year.

Now, figuring out the best way to spend time together is key.

I highly recommend making the decision together and doing things that the entire family wants to do. Don't force your teen to do whatever you want to do, because if they hate the activity and are miserable the entire time, it will reinforce a "family time equals miserable" mindset.

My family's go-to activity is going to the movies. Each of us loves movies, popcorn, and movie candy, so the "family time" is super enjoyable for all of us. After the movie is over, we spend the entire car ride back in intense debates about the characters and how good the movie was.

And, when it's not 100 degrees outside, we also quite enjoy going on walks. I love to listen to music and gossip with my sister and listen to my dad go through his next speech for [Alpha](https://alphahigh.school/) and trade glances with my mom when he and my sister trade insults.

Doing these things that everyone in the family enjoys encourages the idea that family time is something good. And during the school year, it can be hard to make the time, so we double down during the summer.

Of course, not every family will enjoy the same things, so here are a few ideas you can pitch to your kid:

1. Playing board games
2. Biking
3. Watching a reality TV show
4. Thrifting & crafting
5. Getting ice cream

1. Passion Projects

There are two crucial benefits to encouraging your teen to spend time on passion projects over the summer.

The first is that these projects can really help you stand out during college applications. Obviously, I'm no expert, but every video I've watched by college admissions officers says that it's important to show that you are really passionate about something, and that you have something special that no one else does. In [Austin Scholar #3: The Sheep God of Catan](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-3-the-sheep-god-of), I talk more about the importance of having and spending time on a unique passion. Anyway, benefit number one: colleges will like it.

The second benefit is a more introspective one. Spending time on something you're passionate about gives you deep satisfaction that you are doing something of value. And obviously, a lot of teens won't know what they are passionate about just yet, so giving them the opportunity to experiment and try to find their 'sheep' can be the first step to their passion projects.

Some ways to start:

1. Going to summer programs/camps, like

   1. [Putney Student Travel](https://goputney.com/)
   2. [GRAMMY Camp](http://www.grammyintheschools.com/programs/grammy-camp)
2. Taking online courses, like

   1. [Coursera](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwjFz6fSgPL4AhXKFtQBHXFJDzMYABAAGgJvYQ&ae=2&sig=AOD64_3X3mh8BV90QDkr4XciIbsUPtEbaQ&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwi_qp_SgPL4AhVaj2oFHS9YALUQ0Qx6BAgEEAE)
   2. [Masterclass](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwjW2sXcgPL4AhUaFNQBHcRUAk0YABAAGgJvYQ&ae=2&sig=AOD64_1EXt2PpiLvjY8ExT2yDxY34ulW3g&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwj-9bzcgPL4AhVfmWoFHfBbCb8Q0Qx6BAgDEAE)
3. Reading books, articles, and Twitter feeds

1. Accomplishments & Productivity

Now. To add structure. This is what most people think of when they think of having a productive summer. And yes, this stuff is important too. But, please make sure that these accomplishments and productivity aren't the only things you encourage your kid to do with their time off.

Here are a few basic productive things that your teen should spend time on this summer:

1. Getting a job
2. Working towards a driver's license
3. Completing summer homework
4. Getting ahead on next year's classes
5. Working out

1. Trying Something New

Finally, summer is the time for exploration and experimentation! Encourage your teen to use this free time to try something new. For me, this is what I love most about summer.

Go to a new restaurant, store, or coffee shop.

Visit a new city, state, or country.

Try a new sport, craft, or food.

I love this part of summer because I get to face the world with reckless abandon and do completely new things and have unforeseen experiences.

If there is one thing you take away from this week’s newsletter, please just encourage your teen to explore the world around them.

### **A Letter To Teens**

Obviously, summer's already started, but that doesn't mean that everything's set in stone.

Sign up for that course on getting Twitter followers.

Apply for that barista job.

Go to that movie with your family.

Have a deep, valuable summer.

Summer is a gift, so don't waste your time. Spend it doing what gives your life value.
