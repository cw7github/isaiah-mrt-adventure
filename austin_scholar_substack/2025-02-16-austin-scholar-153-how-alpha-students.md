### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How Alpha students learn 2.5x faster than public school kids
2. Your educational app cheat sheet
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

The moment I felt myself get sick after getting back from Sahil Bloom’s book launch event, I knew I had to quickly turn things around. So, I decided to sleep for twelve hours. Every night. All weekend. And what do you know! Come Monday morning, I felt excellent – completely revived and prepared to tackle the second half of winter quarter. Sleep, I suppose, really is healing. It works for both your physical and mental health. I think I’ve mentioned this before, but my one of my favorite emotional check-ins goes like this:

If you feel like everyone hates you, take a nap.

If you feel like you hate everyone, have a snack.

If you feel like you hate yourself, take a shower.

If you feel like everyone hates everyone, go outside.

Honestly, nothing beats going back to the basics.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How Alpha students learn 2.5x faster than public school kids

[Last week](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-152-americas-students), after I explained the atrocious NAEP results, I showed how you can use online, adaptive, AI-powered apps to transform your kid’s education.

This week, I’m proving my argument – and I get to have a little more fun talking about the good stuff: the solutions to all of the negativity and problems I outlined last week.

The results from Alpha’s last academic year have been released, and they are absolutely outstanding. Students are learning at an unprecedented rate in just **two hours per day**.

In fact, Alpha students learned **2.5 times more** (2.5x) than students who sit in class for six hours each day and go home to slog through homework.

2.5 times more.

In two hours.

That’s crazy.

So not only do traditional classrooms not teach your kid [anything](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-152-americas-students), but even if they were teaching your kid everything they need to know, the six-plus hours of academic work a day would still be wasting time.

You don’t need six hours to learn the material. You just need two.

Online apps allow kids to learn efficiently – which means they allow kids to take back their childhoods.

Now all of the skeptics might be wondering, *how do we measure that 2.5x learning?*

Three times per year, Alpha students take the [NWEA MAP test,](https://www.nwea.org/family-toolkit/) a nationwide test that millions of students around the country take. It allows parents to see how their child is performing via nationwide percentile ranking.

That’s how we measure that 2.5x. MAP provides data on how much the average student learns in a year (spoiler alert: it’s usually not that much). Alpha doubles that number as our definition of “learning 2x.” For example, if you look at this NWEA grid, you can see that a 5th grader goes up four points in math between fifth and sixth grade. Alpha kids will go up eight points.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q2YC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ebafd7e-1f09-4462-9b82-5eecd4254942_972x1262.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q2YC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ebafd7e-1f09-4462-9b82-5eecd4254942_972x1262.png)

*(MAP also allows us to see other insane facts, like, for example, that the 50th percentile twelfth grader and the 99th percentile third grader get the same score on the NWEA MAP math test.)*

And because of the outstanding results Alpha has, a lot of X trolls try to argue that Alpha is a school just for gifted and talented students. This is absolutely not true. Alpha does not reject students based on their incoming academic profile.

However, we opened a new school 6 months ago, [gt.school](https://gt.school/), that’s specifically for gifted and talented students. You must test in the top tenth percentile to be accepted.

Here are their initial, absolutely incredible results (each one of these numbers is how many times above the average rate our students are learning):

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wtLw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b1ae978-0a67-406c-99a2-21f981e4fe36_510x296.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wtLw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b1ae978-0a67-406c-99a2-21f981e4fe36_510x296.png)

Yes, that’s an average of learning **five times as much** as a standard school student across all four subjects.

A lot of parents know that their gifted child is being held back by the structure of standard schooling. The bar is so low, they might not even realize by how much.

While these aren't year-over-year results, our academic team believes that we will set the gt.school standard at a minimum of 3x learning and possibly higher.

Don’t let your kid be dragged down by a system that won’t teach them basic reading skills or how to understand a graph. Online apps can transform your kid’s education – you just have to unleash them.

What apps should your kid use, then?

Well, here are the apps that every Alpha student is using to learn more than twice as much as they would in a standard school in just [2 hours](https://2hourlearning.com/) every day:

* Math: [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/) or [IXL math](https://www.ixl.com/math)

The middle school students who used Math Academy instead of IXL math ended up learning five times more – I’ve talked about why I love Math Academy in the past and it just continues to impress me!

Of course, Math Academy is probably easier to “game” or cheat at than IXL math, so picking which app you use for your kid definitely depends on their motivation to learn. If your kid is even slightly motivated to learn math, I’d recommend using Math Academy. If you’re studying for a specific test, though, IXL is great because it has pre-curated lesson plans for test prep.

* Reading comprehension: AlphaRead (the world’s first generative AI-based reading platform)

This year was the first time Alpha used AlphaRead as our core reading platform. The reading scores improved (2.3x) compared to using leading apps like [NewsELA](https://newsela.com/), [CommonLit](https://www.commonlit.org/en) or [ReadTheory](https://readtheory.org/). More importantly, Alpha now controls the content quality and can embed [Core Knowledge](https://www.coreknowledge.org/) sequences into the articles (e.g. they read articles directly aligned to the historical time period they’re learning about at the same time) to ensure the students become the most knowledgeable learners (of all subjects) in the country.

For early readers, though, Alpha used [Khan Kids](https://learn.khanacademy.org/khan-academy-kids/) and [Lalilo](https://lalilo.com/?language=en).

* Language arts: [IXL Language](https://www.ixl.com/ela) and [eGumpp](https://egumpp.com/)

IXL Language tackles pretty much every major language arts topic and has the same sort of curated lesson plans, but if you want to get every grammar question correct on the SAT, use eGumpp. The interface is very boring and the app can get frustrating, but eGumpp has incredible results.

* Science: [IXL Science](https://www.ixl.com/science) and generated NGSS lessons (plus embedding some of the science Core Knowledge curriculum into the AlphaRead articles to improve science knowledge)

A big part of science knowledge is understanding how concepts get applied in the real world. Reading about real-life science uses and innovations (such as in AlphaReads articles) is a big help. If you want to re-create this, you could find pre-existing articles on the applications of the concepts your kid is working through (e.g. I remember loving the space mission IXL lessons, so you could show your kid interesting articles about space travel after they complete that lesson). It would be extra work for you, but you never know what might make your kid fall in love with science.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Tom Brady on how to beat the Chiefs](https://x.com/KTmBoyle/status/1888626967387242803)

Becoming an expert is the most valuable skill you can learn.

In order for Brady to play against a team, he has to know that team better than they know themselves. That knowledge is what allowed him to play a strong game – and what allowed him to win seven Super Bowls.

This doesn’t just relate to football, though. If you can be consistently obsessed with a topic, you’ll soon be able to identify insights that other people can’t because they don’t have enough context. [Learn how to learn](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-147-three-steps-to) something so well that you can see connections that most people miss. That’s how you become an expert. That’s how you become the best.

2. [355 the Musical](https://ktla.com/business/press-releases/cision/20250207DA14203/viral-all-teen-355-the-musical-to-debut-at-tony-award-winning-theater-54-below/)

I am beyond excited to announce that Maddie Price, an Alpha High student (who’s also one of my best friends!) debuted her musical, 355, at a Tony Award-winning theater!

I am so so proud of her and, honestly, her work speaks for itself. Through documenting her creation process, previewing clips, and curating an all-star cast of teen stars, she’s amassed over 21 million views on TikTok and sold out the musical debut. And she’s only sixteen years old. Sixteen.

Maddie is such a clear example of how teenagers have the ability to turn passion and love into something incredible. I’ve watched her send cold email after cold email, write and rewrite song after song, and put her entire heart into creating this musical.

Teenagers are capable of reaching the stars – you just have to let them try.

3. [It’s time to abandon the lecture](https://vanderbilthustler.com/2025/01/27/price-it-is-time-to-abandon-the-lecture/)

A few weeks ago, I wrote about how Stanford officially convinced me that the lecture model is not an effective way to learn – and I’m happy to report that I’m not the only Alpha graduate who recognizes this. Aside from the multitude of phone calls I’ve had with my friends about the topic, my best friend, Peyton Price, wrote an article for the Vanderbilt Hustler about it.

She explains how “after a semester at Vanderbilt, where I spent most of my time in introductory classes located in big lecture halls, my suspicions of how inefficient lecturing can be have been confirmed. In any given lecture, you can spot disengaged students online shopping or playing computer games.”

This, too, has been my experience. And if I’m being totally honest, sometimes I’m the one scrolling on Amazon or turning off my Wifi to play the Dinosaur game. It’s just the nature of the lecture style – every student can’t be engaged at the same time because some material is too easy, and some seems *way* too hard to begin to understand. I’ve been in both scenarios.

Now, I talk a lot about why this matters in K-12 education, but Peyton takes it a step further to why *college specifically* should emphasize a more adaptive model:

“College and education as a whole should primarily aim to teach us how to learn on our own, not how to sit and passively consume information — a skill that will not be valuable in a future career…The lecture model inadequately prepares us for the future. College should teach students how to learn, not just how to listen to someone explain something. The confidence and practical skills from active learning [are](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/blog/what-is-active-learning#:~:text=Active%20learning%20encourages%20students%20to,they%20transition%20into%20their%20career.) essential to successful careers. When students graduate from university, they should feel confident using technology and active-learning strategies to teach themselves new skills needed to achieve their goals.”

And this is so true. The skills you learn in college don’t prepare you to be an innovator or to step outside the norm – they prepare you to sit passively, listen, and follow directions. Is that what you want your kid to learn?
