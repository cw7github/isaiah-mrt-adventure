### **Hey, y'all!**

Getting good grades and studying hard is helpful advice for high schoolers. But so is being a risk taker, putting your family first, and fighting like an underdog.

Some of the best advice I've ever found for navigating high school (and life) has come–not from academics–but from a [Survivor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series)) champion.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

2. How Your Kid Can Strategize Their Way To Their Dream Life (What Everyone Can Learn From Boston Rob)
3. My Favorite Clips of Boston Rob in Action

So, big news: I’m scheduled to take the SAT in March. This past weekend, I got 1550 (my goal!) on a practice test. And you know something funny? I consistently score better in the math sections than in the writing section. I literally write for at least two hours every single day, yet it’s my weakest section on the SAT.

Anyway, in preparation for March, I’m going to be watching a lot of Khan Academy videos, doing practice IXL questions, and scrolling through hundreds of “here’s how to solve the hardest SAT problem” TikTok videos. Wish me luck.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How Boston Rob Taught Me To Make Friends

My idol, the person I try to emulate most in my everyday life, is [Boston Rob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Mariano).

You might know Boston Rob as someone who played the perfect game of Survivor or as a ruthless Amazing Race contestant.

Or maybe you know him as a master manipulator: someone who will lie, cheat, and steal his way to his goals.

*Um, Austin? Why would someone like that be your idol?*

Well, Boston Rob flawlessly used these tactics to win Survivor–*and* come first in seven legs of The Amazing Race, meet his wife, and form long-lasting friendships.

I can definitely learn from someone like that, especially on the social aspects.

As many of you already know, I’m a huge introvert. I’ve always had trouble understanding and navigating social interactions–and I always end up overthinking them.

But as I watched Boston Rob's seasons of Survivor and The Amazing Race, I studied what made him so good at dealing with other people.

When Rob forms alliances and makes plans with other people, his approach always has two things in common: he gives consistent, undercover compliments and he makes others think his idea was their own.

The subsequent alliances have been pretty successful, if I’m being honest. People want to work with him and his plans usually end up being carried out.

So, I’ve tried to start doing those two things in my own conversations.

I try my best to compliment my friends every day so they associate me with feeling good about themselves. And I’ve been working on planting little seeds of an idea into their minds, so when they come up with a brilliant idea of what to do on the weekend, it’s what I want to do.

Is it kind of manipulative? Yes.

Are my friendships already improving? Also yes.

Boston Rob has so many other pieces of fantastic, actionable advice that can completely change your high schooler’s life. Let me share some of my favorites.

### How Your Kid Can Strategize Their Way To Their Dream Life (What Everyone Can Learn From Boston Rob)

Boston Rob wrote the only life advice book your kid will ever need, [The Boston Rob Rulebook: Strategies for Life](https://www.amazon.com/Boston-Rob-Rulebook-Strategies-Life/dp/0989338622).

His rulebook covers everything from achieving goals to forming relationships. The tools Boston Rob used to win Survivor and build his dream life can help your teen find theirs.

Here are Rob’s 19 most impactful lessons, adapted for high schoolers:

1. **Know who you are and what you stand for.**

As a teenager, it can be really hard to know who you are. But what you *can* do is make decisions and act in a way that you’re proud of. Minimize the number of stupid, avoidable choices that you’ll cringe at when you’re older.

If you’re struggling to make a choice, ask yourself if you would want someone telling your future kids this story someday. Be the kind of person that makes yourself proud.

2. **Be adaptable.**

You need to remember that anything can change in the heat of the moment. Yes, you need to have a plan. But you also need to have a backup plan. And a backup plan for your backup plan.

While you're in class, or with your friends, or planning for your future, spend time identifying the things that could possibly go wrong and coming up with plans to rectify the situation.

“If I don’t get an A on this test, I can ask for an extra-credit assignment.”

“If my friend doesn’t want to watch a movie, we can bake cookies.”

Your plans need to be both detailed and specific, ready for you to act on them. You also need to have long-term and short-term plans. And, you need to be able to recognize when you need to abandon one plan and move to another. If something really isn’t working, move to your backup plan.

Be ready for things to change at the drop of a hat and prepare accordingly.

But you must remember: “There’s a certain degree of unquantifiable luck involved in everything that we do. It’s the great equalizer.”

You won’t be able to plan for everything, but your life will be much smoother and more successful if you are ready to adapt.

3. **Do your homework.**

Education comes from everywhere. Yes, academic stuff is important, but learning from your environment and the people around you is too.

But, regardless of what you want to do, if you want to be successful, you have to do your homework. You have to know your competition and what it’s going to take to get you where you want to be. Spend that extra hour preparing for the interview or researching a college. It’ll pay off.

4. **Nobody likes a crybaby.**

To be clear: crying itself isn’t a bad thing. But it is bad to wallow in your sadness and frustration and wait for someone to fix things. If you really want to change your situation, you have to put in the effort. No one’s going to do it for you. Be strong, lean on your family and friends for support, and get to work.

5. **Clean it up.**

Get your act together. Whether it’s your room, backpack, outfits, language, or anything: clean it up.

6. **Turn the tables.**

If something goes wrong, don’t panic or give up. Work to turn the situation in your favor. And if you need help, make others see that your plan is in their best interest too.

7. **Be positive.**

People like being around the people they like. If you exude positivity and confidence, others will want to be your friend so they can absorb some of those good vibes.

8. **Let others help you.**

You’re going to have to rely on someone else at some point in your life. High school can be really hard, but you don’t have to go through it alone. Whether it’s with academics, sports, friends, or passions, you’re going to need some help. Don’t be so proud that you reject those that love you.

9. **Stay cool.**

True champions shine under pressure. You have to learn to keep your mind calm and focus on the task at hand.

And the best way to learn how is to practice–to put yourself into more high-pressure situations. (Take extra practice tests, do something scary, play a family board game, etc.)

Whenever you do get stressed, make a list of small, one-minute tasks. Then, just take it one minute at a time.

10. **Be a risk-taker**

If you don’t take a risk, you’ll never know what could’ve been. A risk-taking life will be so much more interesting than a safe one. And in the end, the rewards will be worth the scars.

So apply for that competition. Ask your crush out. Take the leap.

11. **Get organized.**

Create a feeling of comfort in an uncomfortable situation. Make that to-do list every week. Build those pre-test habits. Set up reliable systems for doing things. You can’t be productive without some order.

12. **Family comes first. Always.**

Don't take your friends or family for granted. They’re people who would do anything for you. Try and find common ground with your family so you can work towards similar goals.

13. **Life is a social game.**

The harsh truth: Unless you have the respect of the people around you, you’re never going to succeed. Most people will only give you one shot to earn their respect, so don’t mess it up by being brash and rude.

You have to be conscious of the image you’re putting out there of yourself and make sure it’s one you won’t regret later on.

You also have to be conscious of other people’s feelings, desires, and motives. Learn to be a good listener and try to understand what the other person wants from you–and what they’ll give you in return.

“Life is one big social game and you have to know how to play it. Otherwise, you could be the one that’s getting played.” – Boston Rob

14. **Fake it ‘til you make it.**

Be honest with yourself about what you don’t know. Then, try to find someone who’s an expert in that area and figure out a way to get them to teach you.

A book, YouTube video, or 1-on-1 conversation works. (Most of the time, if you just ask someone, they’ll want to help you. A little ego-stroking never hurt anyone–especially not a high schooler.)

Surround yourself with people who are smarter than you. Try to watch what they do in certain situations, then emulate it. Listen to them and soak up as much information as you can. Imitate those successful people until you’ve become them.

15. **Beware of the underdog.**

The underdog is the most dangerous adversary because they have nothing to lose. Become someone who will do whatever it takes to win. If you want to be successful, you have to put your whole heart into everything you do.

And if you attack a problem (an exam, essay, activity) with everything you’ve got, you can hold your head up high no matter what the end result.

16. **It costs nothing to be courteous.**

“If you're somewhere crowded and you see an elderly person standing up, you offer them your seat.” Acting in a considerate, gracious manner will improve the lives of the people around you–and will make people like you more.

(Honestly, as long as you do the kind thing, it’s okay if your motivation isn’t noble.)

17. **Tell me who you go with, and I’ll tell you who you are.**

Ask yourself this: What do I want out of life, and are the people I'm currently hanging out with the right ones to get me there?

In high school, it can be really hard to pick the “right” friends. It can help to ask yourself if your friends will encourage you to have the life you dream of.

And a little tip? Hang out with intelligent, successful people, and some of it is sure to rub off on you.

18. **Never, ever, ever give up.**

It doesn’t matter how bad or hopeless you think that things are–you have to keep fighting. Expect the unexpected. Work your way back in, back to the top. Circumstances can change in an instant, so don’t quit before they do.

19. **Never count out the Red Sox.**

Obviously. (Even when they didn’t re-sign J.D. Martinez. [Check out my interview with him here.](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-36-the-four-skills))
