### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Bad test score, or the end of the world?
2. The best way to support your teen’s test stress
3. Scholar’s Sources: My favorite options for when things “go wrong”

I finished my fourth and final AP of the year on Thursday. It’s been three weeks of intense academic focus, high levels of anxiety, and late study nights, but I’m finally done. I spent all of Friday relaxing and resetting so I can crush my last few weeks of school.

I’ve also been reflecting a lot on how test stress has been affecting me, which is what I’m going to write about today.

### Bad test score, or the end of the world?

Most parents think their kids’ test stress is just about the scores..

But the truth is–to high school students, a single bad test score can change their entire life.

They’re not just being dramatic. It actually feels catastrophic.

Here are a few of the most common thoughts that kids can have before taking a big test (like the AP):

If I don’t get a good score…

* I won’t be able to go to the college I want
* I won’t be able to major in the subject I want
* I’m not smart enough
* My parents will be mad at me
* My friends will think I’m stupid
* It will mean there’s something wrong with me (because my friend or sibling got a good score)
* My life will be ruined

It’s a lot more narratives than simply “I won’t get a good score.”

It’s the fear of what happens *after* they get their score that causes the stomach-turning, insomnia-inducing, utterly crippling anxiety.

It doesn’t matter how false these statements are–or what evidence exists to the contrary. These big test scores can change a kid’s perception of themselves: “If I don’t get a good score on AP Language, it will mean I’m a bad writer. I’ll have to give up my dream of majoring in English.”

The biggest fear, though (at least for me), is that “I’m going to disappoint my parents if I get a bad score.”

And, obviously, that’s a really hard one for parents to help their kids with.

Just saying “I promise I won’t be disappointed in you!” really isn’t going to help. It will just feel insincere. Your kid won’t trust that you mean it.

So, how can you help with the stress?

Well, the two most common responses that parents have during AP week (“Don’t stress–you’ll be fine” and “Make sure you study really hard before your test so you can get a good score”) are both counterproductive.

They contradict each other when used in tandem: telling them to just work harder (they’re trying!!), or telling them that they don’t have to get a good score anyway–so why bother studying? And neither one is very helpful.

### The best ways to support your teen’s test stress

Really, the best support is somewhere in the middle of these two things. And ideally, you want to *show* your kid how much you support them, not just tell them.

Basically, you want to communicate to your kid: “make sure you’re prepared, but also make sure you take care of yourself. And, no matter what happens, we’ve got this.”

Support can be about being in your kid’s cheerleader: “Come study at the kitchen counter and I’ll work with you until 8:00, but after eight you should go to bed because sleep is more important than that extra hour of cramming.”

Support can also be about helping your kid put things into perspective. Bad scores are uncomfortable, but there are always other options: “Okay, you’re a sophomore. If you take your AP test and you don’t get the score you wanted, you can take it again next year. You don’t even have to retake the whole class. We’ll just buy the Princeton Review book and you can use it to study on your own and take the test again next spring.

And, if you’re a junior or a senior (or simply can’t retake the test), you can always take online college credits to supplement a not-great score. There are other paths besides this one test score.”

Give your kid options, but don’t minimize that it’s an important test. It is, after all, a culmination of everything they’ve learned this year.

If you tell them not to worry about it because it’s not an important test, it feels like you don’t get all the work they put in.

Instead, acknowledge what they’re feeling–“yes, this is a big, hard, important test and I understand that you’re stressed, but we can still move forward it if it doesn’t go well.”

“Yes, it’s easier to get a good score the first time, but every problem is solvable.”

You’re helping soothe your kid’s fears, but you’re also teaching them how to think about problems and find options when issues arise.

Which is a life skill that goes way beyond taking tests.

My parents are really good at all this. They work together to ensure I feel both supported and acknowledged.

My mom makes me breakfast on test mornings. She tells me that I can study however much I feel like I need to–but also that I’m working super hard and that I can do this. She takes the “acknowledge the stress” approach.

She completely understands I’m anxious and helps me no matter what.

My dad says that “Oh, this one test won’t break your application. There are other ways to get into a good school than just AP tests.” He takes the “supportive” approach, so I know that he’ll help me figure out where to go next if I don’t get the score I want.

Together, my parents’ approaches make me feel so much better about taking these exams because I have both food to help me get through the actual test (thanks Mom!) and the knowledge that both of my parents will still love me and care for me, no matter how I do on the test.

Even if I fail, my dad will still tell me “It’s fine–that specific test doesn’t matter. But here’s what we’re going to do next,” and my mom will still make me breakfast.

They show me they understand and are in my corner, so I know they’ll continue to support me no matter how I do on my APs.

Your kid needs both support and acknowledgment. Of course, you need to do find a way to do this that feels natural and sincere and fits your relationship with your kid.

Just like each of my parents has a different approach when supporting me.

The bottom line is to make sure to figure out how you can help your kid feel seen, heard, understood, supported (even if things go badly), and loved (no matter what).

In the end, doing this will make your relationship with your kid much stronger. Your kid will be more comfortable sharing because they’ll trust you and your ability and willingness to help them.

Just one small conversation during a stressful time can go a long way.

### Scholar’s Sources: My favorite options for when things “go wrong”

Here are a few of those alternative paths (besides just crushing your test scores!) that I talked about :)

1. [Outlier Courses](https://www.outlier.org/)
2. [Cornell Pre-College Studies](https://sce.cornell.edu/precollege/program/online)
3. [Class Central Ivy League Courses](https://www.classcentral.com/collection/ivy-league-moocs?certificate=true)

All three of these platforms will allow students to showcase their commitment and abilities in a subject–even without taking an AP.

Of course, there are other ways to make up a bad score besides taking a class, so just reach out if you have any questions on how you can best support your kid. I’d love to help.
