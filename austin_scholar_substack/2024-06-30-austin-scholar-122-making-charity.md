### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: My sister and Adlerian psychology
2. Making charity selfish: the secret to getting your kid to volunteer
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

As you read this, I am on my way back to Austin (literally – I’m on an airplane as I’m posting this). After a truly lovely two-and-a-half weeks with my friends, I’m ready to see my family again and sleep in my own bed :) Stay tuned for next week’s newsletter to hear about the trip and the things I’ve learned about independence!!

### Austin’s Anecdote: My sister and Adlerian psychology

For pretty much any high schooler, charity and volunteering are just things you do to get into college.

It seems bad to say, but I was no different. If I’m being incredibly honest, I wanted to start the [Learn and Earn program](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-73-helping-500-ukrainian) so I could get into a good college. So I traveled to Ukraine and spent a month setting up a program to help Ukrainian refugees get their education back on track. The first two weeks were really hard, and any time I was struggling, I would calm myself by remembering that the work I was doing would really help me secure the future I wanted for myself.

But as time went on and I started to see *actual* results – kids saying that what we were doing was helping them – my motivation began to change.

I started getting up every morning for the kids. It made me happy to make them happy. I felt like I was changing lives.

I eventually realized the reason for this transition after talking to my sister.

My sister loves to read books that sound impressive to other people, so, ironically, one of her favorites is called *The Courage to be Disliked*.

After reading the book, she immediately burst into my room to test her knowledge and prestige on me. She introduced me to something called Adlerian psychology and the idea that true happiness comes from feeling like you’re contributing to your community.

Which, it turns out, is the key to get any kid to start volunteering.

### Making charity selfish: the secret to getting your kid to volunteer

It’s no secret that teens struggle with happiness – study after study shows the declining mental health in teens around the world.

How do we fix it? According to Adlerian psychology, the answer is to get them to contribute to their community.

But how do you get them to care about volunteering?

Based on my own experience, the answer was to make it about them – show them what’s “in it” for them.

If you talk to them about how happiness comes from contributing to their community, they’ll probably be more inclined to want to try it. And all you really have to do is get them started.

The secret is just to make charity selfish.

This may all sound great, but where do you start?

First, have them identify their community that they want to contribute to.

Make sure it’s NOT the community that *you* think they should have, but rather the community your *kid* thinks is interesting – it can be their friend group, school, family, or other identity group.

Next, give them repeated attempts where they can contribute to their chosen community. Here are some examples:

* Make a sweet treat for your friend group
* Plan a fun weekend for your friends
* Write nice cards for your teachers
* Tutor other students
* Do all of the chores for your family members
* Organize fundraising events for a local non-profit you care about
* Create social media pages to raise awareness for a cause important to you

And every time you suggest an activity (although ideally they’ll start to come up with some themselves!), make sure to remind them that contributing to your community is one of the biggest factors in their happiness, or that they felt good about themselves the last time they made a contribution like this.

These repeated attempts will help them form habits of charity and volunteering.

This will get those positive endorphins flowing, where they feel good about helping others, and those endorphins will make them want to continue helping.

Eventually, they’ll get so used to how good and happy they feel after contributing to their community that they’ll no longer need the reminders.

It won’t feel selfish anymore – they’ll feel as though they genuinely want to help other people.

And, teens are constantly worried about themselves, so this contribution will get them to think of others and will (hopefully) break them out of their own bubble. They’ll become more prepared for the world and have a greater awareness for others.

Give kids a reason to contribute to their community and you’ll be shocked at how much happier they become.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [Second Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation)

Another fantastic book in the *Foundation* series. *Second Foundation* felt especially interesting to me because the “Second Foundation-ers” almost act as a higher power controlling the lives of everyone in the Foundation Empire. And they have the power of emotional control, so it brings up questions of free will and inevitability. Such a thought-provoking novel – and it wraps up the entire story extremely well. I personally have to give it 5 stars.

2. [Pierre Cartier’s commandments to Claude Cartier](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwj-vPSjoM-GAxV5ONQBHX-XCOMYABAEGgJvYQ&ase=2&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpZWzBhC0ARIsACvjWRO8WgZm5aIUaL-5lmDjwSgudn_k9bgZSyRNzIbwiQTT2A95wJb6uUkaAhUzEALw_wcB&ei=BwJmZqaZMNmdp84P1f274Aw&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESVeD2Vb2e2QyitMrnNwetgaBQD14cFj2j4a_qN_NLQQ-wxsnsWewUUnbd_tBtnRoLi85YuP-UTNIh7Z3uHZ0RuHuqy_MS4qUmqH5kZWHoMVlQq44owy8&sig=AOD64_3ZEAPuEJJuA6Mduj2qwGxLJkQk2A&ctype=5&q=&nis=4&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwjmuO2joM-GAxXZzskDHdX-DswQ9aACKAB6BAgIEBA&adurl=)

One of my favorite books I’ve read so far this year is *The Cartiers* – and in it, there’s a line that states how Pierre Cartier wrote a letter to his nephew Claude with his “instructions for life.” Since I read it, I’ve scoured the internet to try and find the full version of the letter, but it’s not in *The Cartier*’s bibliography and every AI I’ve used doesn’t believe it exists online. So, instead of writing an entire newsletter on the commandments as I would’ve liked to, here are the commandments Pierre wrote to Claude that are showcased in the book:

* Treat others as you would like to be treated
* Forget the night life
* Accept invitations only from serious people
* Be the first person in to the office and last person to leave
* Marry a soulmate whose parents are financially independent
* Practice religion

What a great list of things to live by – and Pierre Cartier was such a fascinating, successful person, so I know the rest of the list must’ve been just as good. If any of y’all know where the full letter could be found (or if you just have another list of “instructions for life” that I should write about), please let me know!!

3. [How to become more likable](https://x.com/polina_marinova/status/1795843078399685023)

I have terrible social anxiety, so any time I see a \*list\* of rules I can follow in social situations, I’m absolutely in. This thread is full of great advice – it’s a balance between action items such as “say people’s names more” and “do more random acts of kindness” along with more broad rules like “tell compelling stories” and “romanticize risk.” It was a great read and I’ll definitely be using these.
