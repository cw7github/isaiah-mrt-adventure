### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Why you can’t put AI apps in a traditional classroom
2. Austin’s Anecdote: How I’m using AI alongside a traditional education
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

I hope everyone had an incredible Thanksgiving break! I’m headed back to Stanford today and I’m already missing my family and friends. But I am super excited to see all of my fellow Flomies (the name for students living in Florence Moore Hall) when I get back to California.

This upcoming week should be primarily about preparing for finals, which I’m already stressed about. I will definitely be practicing some mindfulness and self-care to calm myself down and take a break in between study sessions (there’s a fun face mask and a meditation YouTube video with my name on them).

Wishing all parents luck with dealing with their finals-obsessed students. Now more than ever is a good time to remind them that they've got this!

### Why you can’t put AI apps in a traditional classroom

Recently, I’ve received a few questions on why schools couldn’t just use online, AI-powered apps alongside their classroom instruction.

Even if AI was just available as a resource to students, it would take a load off of teachers’ plates and they wouldn’t have to change much! Sounds like a great solution, right?

Unfortunately, the current teacher-in-front-of-students structure of most classrooms makes [implementing AI](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-134-a-new-harvard) more difficult than you might think. There are two core problems: the motivation of students and the challenges in teaching after usage of the AI.

One major obstacle to putting artificial intelligence programs in school is the lack of consistent student engagement with these apps when their use is merely encouraged outside of class time.

One study found that when students were simply "encouraged" to use these tools outside of class time, 60% of the students completed less than half of the intended goal (I can’t find the specific study I read, but [this](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8964128/#sec33) one says something similar).

For instance, a Spanish teacher might tell their class to use a language learning app such as Duolingo to reinforce what was covered in class. A majority of the students will not want to complete more academic work on their own time. The few students who *do* complete the after school work will have a better grasp of the concepts covered in class, creating a divide between the students who use the app and the students who don’t.

After multiple weeks following this pattern, it could get extremely challenging for the teacher to instruct a class in which half the students are significantly ahead of the other half.

If this example is reflective of the average classroom, then optional AI usage clearly doesn't work.

Even when students do use online apps, their superpower of giving every student a personalized curriculum makes it challenging for students to then integrate back into a classroom setting.

The disparity in student knowledge levels created by AI-driven learning can lead to a fragmented classroom experience, where the teacher struggles to address the diverse needs of each student effectively.

This disconnect between the personalized learning facilitated by AI and the standardized approach of traditional classrooms makes integrating AI tools nearly impossible.

To fully harness the potential of AI-powered apps, a fundamental shift in the way students are educated is necessary. The traditional model must evolve enough to allow space for students to progress at their own pace. Until then, AI tools will cause more harm in classrooms than good.

There are examples, though, of AI in classrooms working.

One approach that’s been highly effective is [2 Hour Learning](https://2hourlearning.com/).

The schools and programs backed by 2 Hour Learning completely reimagine what education could look like. These schools do away with the teacher-in-front-of-class model altogether.

From afternoon workshops, to teachers serving as “guides,” to spending school hours in sports practice, everything about the school day is transformed to best utilize the abilities of AI apps.

Artificial intelligence can allow every single student to crush academics in just 2 hours per day. It just can’t happen inside of the conventional classroom model.

### How I’m using AI alongside a traditional education

Now, that entire article might sound like a contradiction to what I’m doing: using AI while at Stanford (a traditional learning environment).

But I have to clarify: the above article explains why the entire *system* can’t rely on just jamming artificial intelligence wherever they can into their current approach. Individuals, however, can use AI to superpower their education while stuck in the traditional system.

If switching to a 2 Hour Learning program isn’t an option for you, here’s how I’m using AI at Stanford (and what you can do, too):

1. Pre-Work

I’ve talked about this before, but I used an AI app ([Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/)) over the summer in preparation for my Calculus course at Stanford.

Spending those extra hours on [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/) truly changed my experience with the course – instead of learning all of the extremely challenging concepts of Calculus, I instead only had to learn the types of questions my professor asked. The lectures have been infinitely easier to follow because of my pre-existing knowledge.

And your kid can totally do this too. Over the summer, have them spend thirty minutes to an hour each day working on a math AI app to prepare them for the year ahead. This prep work over the summer is guaranteed to dramatically cut down the hours your kid will spend studying throughout the school year, leaving them time to work on extracurriculars or spend time with friends.

And for an app where you’re just trying to learn the concepts, I would recommend something like Math Academy or even Khan Academy (although your kid definitely needs to want to learn for Khan Academy to be effective – it’s too easy to game).

2. 24/7 Tutor

Of course, there will always be things I don’t understand how to do. For example, the binomial theorem as a sum was definitely not something I learned in Calculus BC, and going into my Mark Twain and American Culture class I had no idea how to debate my side of an argument about Mark Twain. But I don’t panic – ChatGPT is always there to help.

Use this prompt:

*You are a world-class tutor who uses learning science concepts like active learning to help students learn. I’m stuck on this problem:*

*Guide me through how to solve this problem/how to explain this concept/how to think about this argument. Do NOT give me the answer. Instead, ask me questions to guide me there.*

Show your kid how to use this prompt if they ever need help – ChatGPT is the best, least expensive tutor out there.

3. Practice Grader

I’ve been pretty nervous about submitting my assignments in college so far – I never had to, really, in high school. So, I’ve been putting my rubric into ChatGPT and asking it to grade my papers and assignments when I have drafts. Then, I’ll take the points of feedback that ChatGPT notes and fix up my assignment. If there’s an example included, I’ll plug that into ChatGPT as well. Basically, I just want to get an idea of what grade I will get on the assignment and see the things I need to do to improve.

Your kid can do the same thing with their own assignment rubrics and examples – just make sure you tell ChatGPT to be a harsh grader to get the best results :)

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [AskElle’s TikTok account](https://www.tiktok.com/@askelle_?_t=8rhRJgkt102&_r=1)

If you’re a parent who wants their kid to learn how to talk to their crush, tell them to follow AskElle\_ on TikTok. My sister has created a TikTok account filled with advice from her very own app, [AskElle](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/askelle-ai/id6471620444).

The advice the app gives is insanely good and backed both research and real-life examples. You can ask anything from how to ask a girl to prom to conversation starters to gifts for Valentine’s Day. All of my Stanford friends love the help and ideas from AskElle, so I promise it’s been vetted by more than just Elle’s sister :)

2. [The Morning Brew’s gift guide](https://www.morningbrew.com/issues/TBD24?mbcid=37592330.3661326&mid=f7255db92ec14b3dbb4ab007954ac7b0&utm_campaign=mb&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=header_signup)

I shared the Morning Brew’s gift guide last year and I have to do it again – it’s a fantastic list of gift ideas and I think there’s something for everyone. Now that Thanksgiving is over, Christmas has definitely been on my mind, yet I always seem to have the best gift ideas right before I fall asleep, so I forget them in the morning :)

3. [Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9H9qTdserM)

Y’all guessed it: another “Why College?” assignment! It’s a pretty long, yet pretty funny speech by Dr. Robert Sapolsky and so, despite the entertainment value of the video, I understand not having the time or energy to watch it. So, I’ll summarize:

1. Stress causes you physical harm
2. To mitigate stress, spend time with friends and family

Having a strong community supporting you is by far and away the best way to help you through times of intense stress. So to all those parents of high school students: make sure your kid knows that you will support them and be with them through anything. You never know what health problems you’ll be saving them from down the line :)
