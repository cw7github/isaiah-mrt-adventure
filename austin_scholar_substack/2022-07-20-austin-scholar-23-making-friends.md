### **Hey, y'all!**

​​Since I was a little kid, I've always had major social anxiety. I used to have a hard time even talking to other kids at school.

Believe it or not, one of the things that helped me become more confident was actually a game show. You guessed it from the title of this newsletter: [Survivor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series)).

I'm convinced this show has important life lessons that can help every single teen.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I first learned about Survivor – by playing it
2. Making Friends 101: The Survivor Social Game
3. Scholar’s Sources: My favorite resources from Survivor

This week I'm at a PreCollege program at Oxford, where I'll be for the rest of this month. If you've been following my newsletter for a while, you'll know that Oxford is my dream school, and I'm excited to be here.

I wrote and scheduled the next two issues ahead of time, so I can spend all my time focusing on my coursework while I'm here.

I'm excited to update y'all on my adventures when I get back!

If you haven’t heard of or watched Survivor before, here is a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(franchise)#:~:text=Survivor%20is%20a%20reality%2Dcompetition,basic%20survival%20necessities%20for%20themselves.) and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShduO-NVJrc) that give a brief overview of the show. I highly recommend looking at these two sources because I do use a lot of references in the article :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I First Learned About Survivor – By Playing It

At the beginning of my sophomore year, one of my guides ([Alpha’s](http://alpha.school) replacement for teachers) introduced a new life skills workshop called *Alpha Survivor,* based on the TV show by the same name. To be honest, I hadn’t even heard of Survivor before, but I was excited..

This workshop was intended to increase connection within the high school, by pitting two teams against each other in an epic set of challenges

Whatever this game was, it sounded awesome.

To start, we drew our buffs – which is a bandana that basically just shows which tribe we would be competing with for the rest of the game.

Because I’ve been at Alpha for so long, I already knew quite a few of my teammates, so I was ready to play.

In our first meeting as a tribe, we had to decide which of two advantages we wanted to use during the challenge, which was capture-the-flag. We could either have more guards or smaller safe zones. As my tribe made our decision, I could already feel bonds being built.

And then, it was time for the challenge. We went outside into the scorching Texas heat and prepared ourselves for battle. As we neared our destination, we could see that the capture-the-flag battleground was ready for us. And of course, thanks to the beaming sun, we were already sweating by the time we arrived.

Because my friends and I were some of the oldest students on the tribe, we tried to hype-up all of the nervous freshmen as we got ready to start.

Right in the middle of my best friend’s speech, the alarm sounded and the game began.

It was an intense clash between tribes – advantages we’d chosen almost immediately coming into play. Extra guards around the flags and smaller safe zones became crucial as the game went on.

Everyone was coming together as a team.

But, unfortunately, even with all our might, our tribe lost.

And because it’s Survivor, someone has to go.

With heavy hearts, my tribe trudged back to school, all the while giving tribemates encouraging words.

As the wheel spun (elimination was basically a random lottery), everyone held their breaths, waiting for the result.

And then the unthinkable happened: one of the new freshmen was chosen.

My mind was spinning. *No, she couldn’t go home. The main point of this workshop is to help everyone bond and be a team. And trust me, I’ve been friends with these people for a long time. I don’t need this as much as that freshman.*

I decided almost immediately: I would volunteer as tribute.

As I left my tribe, the little freshman came up to me and thanked me, which made the whole thing worth it.

I spent the rest of Alpha Survivor watching everyone make bonds and forge friendships and build community, all while learning strategies for making good decisions.

I was entranced by this game. And so, I went home and watched all forty seasons of Survivor. As you do.

Dramatic retellings aside, I have learned so much from [Boston Rob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Mariano) and [Queen Sandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Diaz-Twine) and just the game in general.

Survivor is a complex game of navigating relationships, building bonds, and utilizing all of the parts of your brain. So, naturally, I had to write about it.

### Making Friends 101: The Survivor Social Game

On my first day of Kindergarten, I didn’t talk to *anyone*. I think I must’ve said one word the entire day: “Here.”

While my social reflex has shifted from “I’m not saying a single word” to “extreme nervous rambling” (Kelsea Ballerini captures me perfectly in her song “[overshare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcJA0_F72V8)”), the stress of talking to people has remained.

But, at least I know I’m not alone.

In basically every high school romcom, the main character has extreme social anxiety and no idea how to talk to people, let alone the star cheerleader or quarterback.

So, yeah. Talking to new people seems to be a challenge for a lot of high schoolers.

Here’s my take on learning how to make friends: pretend you’re on Survivor.

*Um, Austin? Survivor is a game of manipulation and deceit. Why should my kid make friends like that?*

Let me explain what I mean.

I’m not saying that your kid should [lie about their grandma dying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goNuWLSurLs) or backstab their friends in order to meet their goals. Rather, I’m saying that your kid should approach new people as if they need to make a Survivor alliance with them.

What does this mean? Well, I’ve broken it down into three key steps: find similarities, remember “you need me, I need you,” and identify a common goal.

1. Find Similarities

In Survivor, alliances typically form between similar people.

The legendary “[Cops-R-Us](https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Cops-R-Us_(alliance))” alliance was founded on the basis that both Sarah and Tony were cops. And in [Survivor: Winners at War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor:_Winners_at_War), they took this alliance to the end, where Tony ended up winning.

In basically every season, the “strong guys” on the tribe stick together, the “nerdy ones” form an alliance, and the “young girls” hang out. I hate to be stereotypical, but that literally happens in every single season.

People connect with people they can identify with.

So, finding common ground is the first step in making a friend.

Teenagers can start with their favorite things, since there can usually be a lot of overlap.

Whether it’s loving the Boston Red Sox, or being obsessed with Stranger Things, or adoring coffee ice cream, there’s definitely something any two teenagers can rant about. And from there, conversation can flow.

Next, if favorite things don’t work, most teenagers can revert back to their favorite thing to complain about: their parents.

Every single teenager has had their parents force them to go somewhere they didn’t want to go to or tell them to do something they didn’t want to do. And that is a perfect example of a similarity that teenagers can bond over.

So, when in doubt, tell your kid it’s okay for them to complain about you – as long as they make a friend.

1. Remember “You Need Me, I Need You”

The “you need me, I need you” approach is a helpful mindset for your teen to have during conversations.

For some reason, a lot of teenagers fall into the trap of not feeling like they can speak up about the things they know and the value they add to conversations or relationships. This can be super prevalent in teenagers who get nervous during social situations.

But why is that important, you might ask?

Well, let’s go back to Survivor.

The reason that Survivor alliances are necessary is because both parties need something from the other: their vote.

But, there are a lot of other tribe members to form an alliance with, so each castaway also has to show that they should be who the other person forms an alliance with.

To put it simply, “you need me, I need you.”

Each castaway has to prove to the people that they need votes from that they are valuable and worth having a voting alliance with.

To apply this to teenagers building friendships, your teen should both recognize that they need their “friend-to-be” in order to actually make a friend (so be nice to them!) AND recognize the value that they can add to the relationship.

Are they really funny? Do they know a lot of card games? Are they good at math? Do they know an absurd amount about Bitcoin, or Taylor Swift, or Renaissance artists?

All of these are ways to add value to a relationship. Your kid should learn how to give the other person a reason to want to be their friend.

Okay, so: the summary of the “you need me, I need you” mindset:

Treat your friend-to-be with kindness and respect; you need them.

Show off what you can add to the relationship; they need you.

1. Identify a Common Goal

You’re both working towards something – whether it’s getting through a lonely lunch break or reading a book or a class, find something to work towards together

Obviously, in Survivor, everyone’s goal is to win.

Well, when forming an alliance, the castaways can’t say: “I just want to win” because no one’s going to want to work with someone whose sole objective is focused only on themselves, and not the group.

Instead, they need to have a common goal in order to encourage the other person to work with them.

Usually, it’s “Let’s go to the final three together.” or “We just have to make the merge,” or “Final six, final six.” (All jargon, I know, but important components of the Survivor game!)

As seen in Boston Rob’s perfect game (Season 26), forming an alliance so that “we can all get to the final six – then we battle it out from there” ensures that every member of the alliance feels like they can get pretty far in the game, as long as they stay together.

How might this apply to teenagers?

Well, the best and simplest way to solidify a bond is to work together towards something.

Even if it’s as simple as “We just have to get through this boring lecture, then we can get a snack,” or “We just have to finish this book for the English project, then we can watch TV,” both teens accomplishing something together is an entirely different level of connection.

There’s the satisfaction of achieving something, and the bonding of doing it together.

Yay! Friendship achieved.

Obviously, this isn’t a perfect friend-making strategy, but giving a socially anxious or shy teen a list of things to say and how to act in social situations can be a super valuable guide and baseline. So, teach your kid these rules!

And who knows – maybe your kid will turn around and win Survivor with a legendary alliance someday.

### Scholar’s Sources: My Favorite Resources From Survivor

For all of those Survivor fans out there, here are a few super cool sources that came from the show that we know and love:

[The Boston Rob Rulebook: Strategies for Life](https://www.amazon.com/Boston-Rob-Rulebook-Strategies-Life/dp/0989338622) is genuinely one of my favorite books in existence. Though he never explicitly mentions Survivor, pretty much every single one of his strategies clearly stem from the show. With a witty, familiar voice and high-quality life advice, this book is pretty close to perfect.

When I went through [The Survivor Trivia Game Book](https://www.amazon.com/Survivor-Trivia-Game-Book-Ultimate/dp/B096LWMR7B), it really sank in exactly how many hours I’ve spent watching Survivor. This is a really fun book for any Survivor superfan.

The strategy of Survivor is super complex, but it can apply to so many other aspects of life. [This video](https://youtu.be/Q6F8muXakfk) outlines the “Multiple Levels of Thought” theory that is useful in basically any strategic situation. I can get pretty stressed out in social situations, and going through the thought process outlined in the video helps me to clear my head and plan what I’m going to say next.

[The Psychology of Survivor](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Survivor-Psychologists-Unauthorized-Psychological/dp/1933771054) is a super interesting book. It’s a collection of essays written by leading psychologists that breaks down early Survivor strategy. With anecdotes from the game, official scientific studies, and great insights, this book is truly a fascinating look at human behavior.

Finally, for anyone who wants a breakdown of basic Survivor strategy, [this](https://youtu.be/-tPNYMG2H4c) is a great video to watch.
