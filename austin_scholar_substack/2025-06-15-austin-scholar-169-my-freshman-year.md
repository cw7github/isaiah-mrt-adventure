### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: My freshman year at Stanford
2. Is college worth it?
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

I’m now officially done with my freshman year at Stanford! It’s crazy how fast time flies. I won’t say too much here, because most of my reflection is going to be in the anecdote for this week, but I do want to thank all of y’all for allowing me that break during finals and move out week – my stress levels were astronomical and I didn’t think I could write something worthy of publishing on top of everything else.

We’re back, though, to the regularly scheduled programming. I’ve got quite a few newsletters lined up about academic results from Alpha and 2 Hour Learning that will blow your mind, so stay tuned.

### Austin’s Anecdote: My freshman year at Stanford

College is a bundle of different things—academics, teachers, classmates, roommates, dormmates, friends, clubs, sororities, fraternities, sports, special projects, the surrounding environment, guest speakers, parties, and that’s not even an exhaustive list. I wasn’t quite sure what to expect going in, but the parts I ended up loving most were actually totally different from what I’d imagined.

I came in super excited to sit in a Stanford classroom with Stanford professors. Growing up without traditional teachers and using AI tutors, I’d been told I was missing out. And since I was about to go to one of the greatest learning environments in the country, I was ready to see if they were right.

Spoiler alert: not really.

Some professors were fantastic (and the group discussions couldn’t be replicated), but others were dramatically worse than AI. After my first year here, I’m convinced that for most of education, personalized AI tutors utterly crush the classroom lecture model. However, while the classes can be underwhelming, the tests are brutally hard. They definitely live up to Stanford’s reputation for rigor.

Classmates, roommates, and dormmates are the best part of Stanford, hands down. I was bracing for the “death of the Ivy League” hype (that Ivy admission standards aren’t what they used to be), but my peers are super smart, driven, and downright kind. Coming from Alpha, I had sky-high expectations for my friends, and *wow* did Stanford deliver. I’ve had unforgettable experiences with my fellow frosh:

* Doing a group project with [Rintaro Sasaki](https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/44603594/rintaro-sasaki-stanford-college-baseball-freshman-japan-2025), a freshman who’s revolutionizing college baseball
* Staying up until 2 a.m. with my dormmates, debating the immigration op-ed one of them was publishing in the *Stanford Daily*
* Watching classmates swing between supporting the protesters on a food strike and making fun of them
* Seeing two friends drop out of Stanford to launch what they’re convinced will be a world-changing AI startup
* Meeting folks in my math class who also got an 800 on SAT Math, but in seventh grade

People here are legitimately next-level.

Stanford also brings in the world’s heavy hitters as guest lecturers. Interested in startups? We’ve had Sam Altman, the CEO of Nvidia, and the head of DoorDash speak to us. Politics? Hillary Clinton. Entertainment? Marvel’s CEO and the band Coldplay. Social media? JoJo Siwa. They’re all so approachable – by the time they finish speaking, they’ve made you genuinely think, “If they did it, why can’t I?” After you meet enough of these legends, you start to feel like your classmates doing the same thing (see: my drop-out-to-found-an-AI-unicorn friends) could be totally plausible.

So far, we’ve discussed that academics were… meh. But the people and inspiration? They were amazing. *But how was the rest of the experience? How did I grow?*

Well, before I left for Stanford, my parents told me, “Explore everything.” That was the best advice ever. I didn’t lock into a major; I tried literally everything that I thought I could be interested in:

* Figure skating club
* Investing club
* Sports analytics club
* ASSU student government
* Sororities (yes, I got hazed)
* Epic parties and spontaneous trips to San Francisco
* Intro to Computer Science, Data Science, Symbolic Systems, Math, and English classes

This whirlwind year helped me discover parts of myself I didn’t know existed. My dad still can’t believe I became a Pi Phi angel, and I can’t believe I’ll spend my entire summer learning to be an investor.

*Is Stanford “Oppressively Woke”?*I get this question all the time. The culture is definitely California-left-wing and not exactly centrist. But I grew up with the Alpha “both sides” culture, where we debated every issue from all angles, so I don’t find it oppressive. It’s just how the world is.

My generation is staring down insane uncertainty: AI is reshaping jobs, relationships, the economy, even the future of education. What will humans do? Which skills will matter? While none of us have firm answers, there’s no better place – or better crew – to figure it out with than at Stanford.

**Overall grade for Freshman Year: A**

### Is college worth it?

There’s endless debate about college’s future (see Scholar’s Sources). The big question I get now is: *Is college worth it? Is Stanford worth it?* After one year, I can tell you: college is exactly what you make of it. I have friends in Austin who see it as four years of partying—and I worry: will they be ready for an AI world when they graduate?

If you want to get the most out of college, I think there are two important questions you have to ask before you go:

* What are your goals?
* What would make college a home run for you?

After one year, I feel like a success because I had a clear (if flexible) vision for what I wanted: exploration across academics, clubs, projects, and people. Maybe you want to deepen expertise, accelerate your career, or, like me, try everything under the sun.

Having a north star makes it way easier to track progress and avoid getting overwhelmed. College can feel like a blur of activities, lectures, and deadlines. Pick one clear goal before you start, and you’ll have the framework to evaluate every late-night debate, every impossible midterm, and every guest lecture that leaves you thinking, “Maybe I could do that too.”

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [The Future of College (The Class of 2026)](https://barsoom.substack.com/p/the-class-of-2026?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true)

This incredibly well-written, dense article by John Carter argues that AI is upending universities much like Gutenberg’s press dismantled the medieval monastery system. Accused of moral laxity, administrative bloat, credentialism and ideological monoculture, today’s colleges risk obsolescence as LLMs collapse the cost of “producing” knowledge, and therefore nullify college degrees. Attending college will become a luxury only the wealthy partake in, since they’re the only ones with the ability to spend four years to get a meaningless piece of paper. I *loved* how the author called out Alpha’s program as an example (AI-driven personalized curriculum, where Common Core can be mastered in two hours a day, freeing the rest of students’ time for creative projects). It’s cool to remind myself that Alpha really is leading-edge stuff. Carter then proposes a new model for higher education: schools-as-salons or intellectual “fitness centers,” membership-based, credit-free, focused on self-directed Socratic tutorials and peer reputation rather than grades or diplomas.

If this really is the direction higher education is going, what can you do to prepare your kids for it?

* Encourage your child to experiment with AI tutors
* Treat learning like “intellectual fitness”: set aside daily “deep‐dive” time for a passion project.
* Foster Socratic dialogue at home: ask open‐ended questions, debate current events over dinner
* Explore alternative programs (Alpha School, online bootcamps) alongside traditional schooling

2. [Advice from Sam Altman](https://x.com/benln/status/1929184472513069216)

Sam Altman’s productivity playbook centers on choosing the right work over mere speed, cultivating strong independent beliefs, and carving out time to decide *what* to work on. He stresses compounding growth – small gains over decades – and urges surrounding yourself with smart, ambitious people who support your goals. Altman’s three pillars of prioritization are “Get the important shit done,” “Don’t waste time on stupid shit,” and “Make lots of lists.” He recommends written yearly, monthly, and daily lists (frequently re-transcribed), minimal meetings, and keeping 10% of your calendar open for serendipity. Physical health underpins performance: optimize sleep (cold, dark room; no late alcohol), lift heavy weights three times a week, and add HIIT. He’s also an advocate for a workspace with natural light, long focus blocks, mastery of keyboard shortcuts, and acceptance of occasional low-motivation weeks.

What should you take away from this?

* Help your teen set up daily and weekly priority lists—revisit them together every evening.
* Teach them to book “thinking time” on their calendar before diving into work.
* Ensure their bedroom supports good sleep: cool, dark, quiet, and screen-free before bed.
* Encourage regular exercise: family weight-lifting sessions or weekend HIIT workouts.
* Model healthy eating: intermittent fasting mornings and low-sugar, anti-inflammatory meals.
* Create a dedicated, well-lit workspace and help them learn basic keyboard shortcuts.

If your kid knows who Sam Altman is, you can package these habits as “becoming more like Sam Altman” or “this is how you become successful like he is.” When my parents try to give my productivity advice I don't always want to listen, but when I know it's coming from someone I admire I'm much more likely to listen.

3. [Breaking free from “brain rot”](https://x.com/bluewmist/status/1930952173577511348)

This viral thread prescribes a battle plan against social media addiction and “brain rot.” The key habits that kids can definitely work on are:

*“- Challenge your brain with books, essays, articles, long-form content. Substack is perfect for this. It might feel hard at first, because we're addicted to quick dopamine, but push through to retrain your focus.*

*- When you find yourself doomscrolling next time, try creating something. Write, draw, listen to music without the video, work on a puzzle, or on a project that requires more patience. The more you actively do, the less you'll feel like some passive bystander in your own life.*

*- Journal!!! your thoughts, what you've been doing or watching. Everything. Brain dumps are good and freeing.*

*- Set a no-screen period in your day.*

*- Do nothing on purpose, because we have forgotten how to just exist. Stare at the ceiling! Watch the clouds! Your brain needs empty space again to process thoughts instead of constantly being fed more information.”*

Kids are constantly bombarded with information, media, and the ability to scroll for hours. Encourage them to detox and give their brains a break.
