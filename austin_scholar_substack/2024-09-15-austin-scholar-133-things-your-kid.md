### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: What I’m bringing to college
2. Things your kid is worrying about (and how to help them)
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

The big day is here: I leave for Stanford tomorrow. I truly cannot overstate how grateful I am to each and every one of you for helping me get there. I definitely would not be the person I am or have the opportunities I do without y’all. For over two years, you have all followed me throughout the highs and lows of my high school journey, supporting and encouraging me every step of the way.

As I transition into life as a college student, be prepared to learn about the true differences between apps and a teacher (I will be doing both Math Academy and Stanford lecture classes for math). I'll also be writing about the life skills you need to teach your kid (what has helped me succeed in college and what I wish I’d learned), and I'll be sharing clear, actionable advice on how you can help your kid achieve great things and get into the school of their dreams. My biggest goal is to help as many kids as I can be set up for success after high school and know how to thrive in this crazy world.

Again, thank you all for your incredible support. I can’t wait to go on this next adventure with y’all!!

### Austin’s Anecdote: What I’m bringing to college

Packing for college is stressful. I need to bring everything necessary to live on my own – but not too much, because the dorms are super small. My anxiety is screaming at me that I’ve forgotten something important.

But here are some things I made sure to put in my suitcase.

1. Austin Community College ID

The first college I was accepted into was Austin Community College when I was in 5th grade.

Alpha’s head of school brought a bunch of us tiny elementary school kids to the ACC campus to take their admissions exam – and what do you know, we passed.

The next weekend, after volunteering at one of my mom’s events, I went back to the ACC campus and smiled with crooked teeth for the camera. And the following fall, I took an accounting class with ACC.

I’m taking this ID to remind myself of my ability to exceed expectations and that there are people who believe in me even more than I do.

2. Collage from my senior trip

While on my senior trip, I collected every plane ticket, train ticket, brochure, and magazine we were given. When I got back, I cut up the paper and made a collage. I photo-copied and gave it to my friends as a going-away gift, but I have the original on my desk and it never fails to make me smile.

That trip secured my friendship bonds and proved that we could be independent and navigate unfamiliar circumstances on our own.

I hope to be reminded of the strength of the friendships I have whenever I feel lonely.

3. Math Academy account

As I’ve mentioned, I’m going to be continuing to use online apps to teach me math while in college. Math Academy is my app of choice and I truly cannot wait to see how it compares to the lectures.

My main goal in using Math Academy is to ensure I’ve mastered the content, not just crammed it for exams.

4. Red panda stuffed animal

A few years ago, I was in New York with my best friends and our moms and I had a really bad day.

I got so overwhelmed by the thick smoke smell and constant movement. My hands started twitching (a tell-tale sign of too much anxiety for me) and I felt like I needed to go hide in a completely dark and quiet room. But one of my friends wanted to check out the toy store FAO Schwarz and I, of course, agreed.

I walked down the stuffed animal aisle and saw a really cute orangey-red animal, picked it up, and immediately fell in love. For some reason, it was just the right amount of squishy and firm and soft and I could feel myself calming down. Squishing it gave my hands something to do to let go of the anxiety and the softness brought me back to reality.

I’m taking this stuffed animal (despite me being an entire adult now) because it proved that I can calm myself down – that even when I’m at my most anxious, I’m able to get back to my baseline.

5. Serenity prayer coin

*God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.*

This is my favorite prayer. I feel as though there’s nothing more valuable than being able to let go of the things that aren’t in your control and focus your energy on fixing those that are.

6. Figure skates

I think this one is pretty self-explanatory – I need figure skates if I’m going to be joining the Stanford figure skating club.

I’m really excited to be able to form a community and make friends through a club built around one of my favorite things to do. Going to the rink and practicing with some friends will be a great way to destress and center myself after a stressful week.

### Things your kid is worrying about (and how to help them)

Going through a big change is scary.

There are so many unknown variables, and so much potential for bad things to happen.

Whether it’s going to college, changing schools, moving, a friend moving, an injury, or a million other scenarios, your kid is going to have some serious fears and worries.

Everyone and every situation is different, but here are some common worries they have and how to help them:

* I won’t or don’t have any friends

The subject of friends is one of the toughest to face while growing up. One thing you could do is

sit down with your kid and make a list of the qualities you’d want in a friend (plays tennis, enjoys cooking, is kind, reads a lot, etc.) and brainstorm places that you could find those types of people.

You likely won’t meet one person who embodies all of those qualities, but if you break it up (go to the local library to find someone who likes to read, join the tennis club to find a fellow tennis player, be kind to classmates to find kindred spirits, go to a cooking class to find budding chefs, etc.) you can find all of the different friends your kid could ever imagine.

Something I think is important for kids to learn is that not all friends serve the same purpose in their life – some people will be study partners while others will give you party invitations. Not every person’s going to fit every box, and that’s okay.

For college students, work through the orientation schedule and find times to go out and meet new people and groups to join to meet like-minded people.

* I won’t succeed

If your kid is worried about doing well in school or their extracurricular activity, one of the best things you can do is help them create a [study plan](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-131-how-to-become).

Come up with all of the resources they’ll need and things they’ll need to learn and put them all in a document where they can check off the items.

Use online apps for school and YouTube videos or online courses for extracurriculars. Help them create something to ensure they succeed.

* I’m not good enough

Love your kids. Not being enough is a hard belief to work through, but encourage them by mentioning the things they *have* done and tell them that you know they are capable of doing anything they set their minds to. Be supportive and bombard them with affirmations.

* Things will go wrong

If your kid is an overthinker, the best thing to do is plan for the worst. Talk them through every scenario they’re worried could happen (For example: “I’ll have a terrible roommate”, “I’m going to fail this test”, “I won’t make the baseball team”) and problem solve.

Ask them what they will do to fix the issues. Create a boundaries list with your roommate if you can’t switch, ask the professor for extra credit, and join a more recreational team and continue training for next year.

And for some things, like who your roommate is, you’ll just have to radically accept (go back to the Serenity Prayer and accept the things you cannot change).

There’s a solution for everything, even if that solution is to accept the situation.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [The Snowball](https://www.amazon.com/Snowball-Warren-Buffett-Business-Life/dp/0553384619)

I’ve finally finished Warren Buffet’s biography and it didn’t disappoint. From scandals at insurance companies to failures with shoe companies to becoming the world’s richest man, the number one thing that stayed consistent was his integrity and refusal to compromise his values. His opinion was trusted throughout the business and financial world because he had never once said or suggested something he himself didn’t believe in.

Another key part of the biography was the emphasis on starting young – the earlier you begin, the bigger your snowball can get. Buffet had been creating small businesses and visiting banks since before he was a teenager. There’s no minimum age requirement to making money.

Aside from the investing advice (my favorites being that Mr. Market throws out random numbers every day, and buy if that number is below your value of a company and sell if it’s over along with always having a margin of safety – don’t buy at $4 if you think the value is $5, wait until it gets to $2), I was truly just struck by the way Buffet stayed true to his values and beliefs. My goal is to feel as secure in who I am that I can do the same.

2. [The number one determinant of success](https://x.com/goinggodward/status/1831460778043719797)

A 70-year study showed that the number one determiner of success was family warmth. I absolutely see how this is true. If you give your kid the ability to feel safe in both taking risks and being themselves, they will be able to reach their full potential. Surround your kid with support and love – show them that mistakes won’t make you love them any less. Tell your kid you love them at least once per day and offer your support when they’re struggling.

3. [Journaling with AI](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/ai-journaling-changed-my-life)

I’ve always been a huge proponent that journaling can help clarify your thoughts and work through any scenario (writing anecdotes about things that are happening in my life always makes them seem more manageable). But if you want to get the most you could out of journaling, using ChatGPT is the way to go.

Prompt the AI with something like:

You are the world’s expert in ACT and Russ Harris and provide DBT solutions (these are my favorite forms of therapy, but you can substitute that with any of your favorite therapists – Brené Brown, CBT, meditation-focused, etc.). Please help me work through a situation in my life. Start by asking me to describe the scenario and then use the therapy structures outlined above to help me problem solve and work through it. Provide specific skills or exercises I can do to feel better.

All you have to do, then, is follow the AI’s instructions!!
