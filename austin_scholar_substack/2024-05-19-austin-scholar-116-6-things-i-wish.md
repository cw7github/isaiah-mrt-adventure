### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. 6 things I wish I knew my freshman year
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to...

We're in the middle of wrapping up the school year at Alpha High, but things are pretty quiet, so I don't have any big updates. Instead, here are the things I’m looking forward to over the next week: I have some super hard pilates classes lined up, I’m working on my reflection of high school speech for graduation, the AP European History exam is coming up, and I’m getting graduation gifts for both the guides and my friends.

Basically, I’m wrapping up my entire high school experience. Crazy.

I'm also working on getting ahead on some newsletters so I can take a break from weekly writing over the summer. I'm so excited for you to get to read all of those soon!

### 6 things I wish I knew my freshman year

On that note, I’ve been thinking a lot about my time in high school and how I’ve grown as a person. For example, four years ago I'd never published anything online in my life. I've evolved quite a bit since then.

There are a lot of things that would’ve been helpful to know during my freshman year to make my journey a little easier on my heart and mind.

Here are the 6 most important things I wish I knew my freshman year (you should forward this to the rising freshmen in your life):

1. Your life will not end with one bad grade

As absolutely cliche as that is, it’s so hard to actually believe.

In my sophomore year, I took AP Calculus BC and studied *so hard*, but I couldn’t understand the topic of Taylor Series, like, at all. I watched so many videos on the topic and of people solving those types of problems, but I couldn’t crack it.

And because they’re such a big part of the actual AP exam, I did not get the score I wanted that year.

I freaked out.

I’ve always, always tried to get good grades and scores in academics and as college applications got closer, this was a pretty big blow.

But instead of sitting in my misery forever, I dried my tears (yes, I’m the type to cry over a test) and made a plan: do an intensive Calculus course the month before next year’s exam and retake the test. There’s always a way forward, and a lot of the time, if you know you can do better, you don’t have to settle. (I did end up retaking it and I crushed my second try at the exam.)

So let’s say you do get a bad grade. Maybe you studied really hard but freaked out during the exam and didn’t score well. Or maybe you forgot about a quiz. Whatever happened, the most important part of your backup plan is knowing how to problem-solve.

If you’re not feeling too hot about one of your AP courses, figure out what your next steps are (hint: you can either not submit your score OR study to retake it the following year – like I did). If it’s a quiz, figure out an extra-credit plan with your teachers. Knowing how to plan for the worst-case scenario is so important both to the stability of your mental health and to keeping your academics at a high level.

And if you plan, that one test score won’t affect you.

2. You are safe to take risks

I’m naturally a pretty risk-averse person. I get scared when I don’t know what will happen next. I avoid dangerous situations.

So when it came time for me to send cold emails and requests to some pretty famous people on Twitter/X, I resisted. I avoided posting on Twitter/X at all for six months after I started my newsletter because I was so scared.

But then I realized that this is *the best* time in my life to take risks.

In high school, you’re fully supported by your parents. You have so much time and energy to put into doing something super cool. Nothing can go *that* wrong.

So take a deep breath and dive in.

3. You will get hate, but they don’t know who you truly are

One of the reasons posting on Twitter/X seemed so risky to me was that I didn’t want to get hate – I felt like I couldn’t handle it.

Whenever I would think about someone saying I was stupid or ugly or incompetent or a million other things, I would get such a surge of anxiety in my heart that I’d totally forget about the opportunities I would gain from posting.

Eventually, though, it became a requirement for school. So I had no choice.

The very first time I posted a thread, I freaked out when I hit publish.

And sure enough, I found that I was right to do so. I got a hate comment.

But when I checked to see who was leaving me a hate comment, I realized that the account was literally a porn bot.

It was ridiculous. And all of a sudden, the hate comments seemed like a huge joke. These people didn’t actually know me.

The people who insult you, who make snide comments and tear you down – those people don’t truly know who you are. Sometimes they’re just porn bots trying to get people to click on their profile.

4. Friendships ebb and flow

I’m a *huge* introvert and have terrible social anxiety.

Which does not bode well for friendships.

Especially when I have a sister to compare myself to who won the “social butterfly” superlative in middle school. And because Alpha High is so small, we pretty much have the same friend group.

If I had a bad day and needed to go hide in my room to recharge the chances were very high that my sister was still hanging out with our friends. Maybe even in the next room. It was *so easy* to feel like I was a terrible friend and super unlikeable compared to my sister who hung out with people 24/7.

But I forgot to realize that the next day, my sister had some extra work to catch up on after school, while I was the one going to get snacks with our friends (because my work was done).

Playing the comparison game never ends well.

Friendships will ebb and flow – you’ll be closer to one friend at some point and another friend at a different time. And that’s okay.

5. Sometimes you need to take breaks

Despite all of my preaching about the importance of taking breaks and taking care of your mental health, it’s really easy for me to slip into old patterns of studying and working from 8:30 am to 8:30 pm without any breaks. Too easy.

Whether it’s ten minutes, an hour, or an entire day, taking breaks *will* rejuvenate you and increase the quality of your work.

When you find yourself overwhelmed, do something else: take a walk, do a puzzle, have a snack, take a nap, take a shower, or talk to your friends.

Then come back and refocus. Everything will seem a lot clearer.

6. Change is inevitable

I am such a different person than I was when I started high school.

I’m even a different person than I was earlier this year.

And that’s not a bad thing.

You will change throughout high school – you’ll have a few years when you think cursing and dying your hair is cool, the another when eating healthy and wearing the latest “in” workout clothes is what’s cool.

Your interests and skills will change.

You will grow.

And that’s the whole point of high school, is it not?

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [The Boston Rob Rulebook: Strategies for Life](https://www.amazon.com/Boston-Rob-Rulebook-Strategies-Life/dp/0989338622)

Although I’ve already written an [entire newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-49-how-your-kid-can) about Boston Rob, I have to reiterate that if there’s one set of truths I could live by, it would be these. High school would’ve been a lot easier if I truly embodied these rules.

Here are a few of my favorites:

* Know who you are and what you stand for
* Be adaptable
* Do your homework
* Nobody likes a crybaby
* Family comes first. Always.
* Tell me who you go with and I’ll tell you who you are.

2. The truth about [college admissions](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-112-my-complete-resource)

For a lot of kids, it feels like high school is just one big prelude to college.

“I have to take these AP courses freshman year so I can get into a good college.”

“I need to join all of these clubs so I can become president by my senior year to help my college application.”

But what do you *really* have to do to get into the college of your dreams?

I wrote a newsletter about it that outlines every single step and provides every resource you could need.

Definitely something I wish I had four years ago.

3. [Fiveable](https://fiveable.me/)

Fiveable is *the best* AP prep tool I’ve used. It has materials for basically every single AP, with topic-by-topic explanations and articles, and pre-exam live reviews that are super helpful. One of the best features is the short quizzes after each topic to ensure you’ve learned the content. Fiveable completely saved my life in Physics this year. I wish I’d started using it earlier. To get the full use out of it, you do have to pay, but there is truly no better tool for AP prep. Highly highly recommend.
