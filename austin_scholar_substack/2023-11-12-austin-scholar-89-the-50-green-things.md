### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: The 50 Green Things
2. How to create a 50 Green Things list with your kid
3. Scholar’s Sources: Some ideas for your own 50 Green Things list

I’m stressed about college. This last week, I’ve literally had nightmares about getting rejected from schools and have been super worried about finishing my applications for the rest of my US schools.

I know I’m in the home stretch, though, so I’m going to keep pushing through.

But, all of this anxiety about college reminded me of a super helpful concept (and the topic of this newsletter): the 50 green things.

### Austin’s Anecdote: The 50 Green Things

My family hasn’t always been as close as we are now – and I haven’t always been this… well-adjusted.

To be super real with you: I struggled a lot in middle school, thanks to my anxiety and the pressure I put on myself to be “the best.”

I wasn’t really that happy for a while.

Years passed and I couldn’t get out of this dark cloud. It all came to a head in 2020 (because of course it did) and my family and I realized that I needed to figure something out.

In the end, we came up with the 50 Green Things.

Basically, every day, I would rate how I’m feeling as red, yellow, or green. Red means that I’m really not in a good place and need help, yellow means that I’m just feeling pretty numb, and green means that I’m feeling happy and fulfilled.

We quickly realized that most of my days were yellow.

But that isn’t a good way to live. I was just in middle school. I should have been acting silly and laughing with my friends as we procrastinated on our homework, not feeling numb.

So, in order to move out of this yellow zone, my family and I created a list of fifty things I could do to bring me out of the yellow zone and into the green.

My list included things like getting Einstein’s Bagels, going to Target, and watching the first Avengers movie. Things that aren’t hard to do, but that I wasn’t prioritizing in my life.

Every day, if I checked in and was feeling yellow, I would stop everything else and do one of the things on the list. And it actually started to work.

Not only was I feeling more fulfilled in my life, but I was actually getting closer to my parents and my friends, since a lot of the 50 Green Things included the people I loved.

And slowly but surely, my “average,” my baseline, stopped being yellow.

My baseline became happiness.

And that’s the power of the 50 Green Things.

### How to create a 50 Green Things list with your kid

I would like to make something clear: your kid doesn’t need to be struggling in their life for a 50 Green Things list to be useful. Because let’s be real: school is stressful, kids are mean, and growing up is hard.

There will always be a time when your kid could use a little cheering up.

The 50 Green Things is also a great way to improve your relationship with your kid. Create a list of things that you like to do with your kid (for example, I like watching a baseball game with my dad or getting my nails done with my mom) and do those things when you feel like your relationship is hurting.

Having this list to go back to when you’re mad at each other or frustrated with life really helps to let your kid feel secure in the connection between the two of you. It reminds them that no matter how loudly they slam their door, you two will always have fun, loving things to do together.

*Why fifty things?* you might be wondering. Well, it’s for two reasons:

1. So you can have options
2. So you know that there are a lot of things that you genuinely like to do

It’s hard to feel like everything in the world is terrible when there are fifty entire things that you know will make you happy to do. For inspiration on what to put on your 50 Green Things list, check out Scholar’s Sources.

So seriously: help your kid make a 50 Green Things list so they can ensure that their baseline is happy, too – or so that you can ensure that your relationship stays strong.

Of course, at this point, it wouldn’t be an Austin Scholar newsletter without an AI prompt you can use to help create this list of 50 Green Things. Here’s the ChatGPT prompt you can use:

*You are an expert activities planner. My [AGE] [SON/DAUGHTER] loves [INTERESTS]. I am creating a list of 50 things we can do together (or that she can do on her own) that will make her happy and excited. Create this list and make sure to include activities of differing prices, lengths of time, and intensity.*

And there you go. You’re already started on your 50 Green Things.

### Scholar’s Sources: Some ideas for your own 50 Green Things list

If you don’t like ChatGPT’s suggestions, here are a few ideas of what you can add to your 50 Green Things:

* Go on family walks

  + Walking is a great way to get fresh air, clear your mind, exercise, and spend time with your family.
* Watch a show with your family

  + My family always has a “Family Show.” Whether we have time in the morning before school or at night before bed, we try to spend a few minutes watching a TV show together. Having a show encourages everyone to want to spend time together and provides an excellent conversation topic. (For example, my family has recently been watching Lessons in Chemistry, Guilded Age, The Amazing Race, and Survivor.)

* Find 20 minutes

  + Find 20 spare minutes to learn about things you find interesting, whether it’s watching a video as you get ready for the day or reading an article on the drive to school. This is an easy way to feel fulfilled, satisfied, and productive.

* Study with friends

  + If I know that I’m going to be studying late, I’ve started to invite a friend or two over to study together. This has allowed me to spend a lot more time socializing and being around other people, while also staying productive. Sitting down and doing homework with my friends has helped me feel a lot less alone.
* Reserve weekends for your friends

  + If studying with friends doesn’t work, then reserving time each weekend to hang out with friends, even if that means waking up before 10:00 AM or finishing homework on Thursday, helps that value to be met.
* Self-care night

  + For a quick refresh, take a night for yourself. Take a bath, do a face mask, paint your nails, light a candle, and watch your favorite TV show. Doing this will help you reset and prepare for the next day.
* Try a new coffee shop

  + This is a really fun way to get outside and take a break from your mundane routine, while still getting your caffeine and sugar.
* Bake your favorite dessert

  + Baking is actually a great mindfulness practice, as you have to be super present to make your confection turn out correctly.
* Make blankets

  + My mom, sister, and I love making these [fleece blankets](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/fleece-tie-blanket-1252959) together. (We donate them to CareBOX, but you can make them for yourself, too!!) They’re super easy and you can make them while watching a show – and you’ll get a comfortable blanket by the end of it :)
* Go to a bookstore

  + This is my favorite thing to do when I’ve had a rough week. I stop by BookPeople and immerse myself in a fantasy world.
