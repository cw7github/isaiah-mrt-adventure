### **Hey, y'all!**

Welcome to the Austin Scholar newsletter! To all of my new subscribers, I'm so excited and grateful that y'all are here! To all of my returning subscribers, welcome back, and thank you for the continued support.

Please forward this newsletter to other parents who want to learn ways to help make twelve years of school less painful and more fulfilling for their children.

This week from Austin Scholar…

1. The Pros and Cons of Khan Academy
2. Three sources on Khan’s effectiveness with high school students

The [previous newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-12-managing-may) went into depth about AP stress and how to manage the challenges that May brings to high school students, and let me tell you, I wasn’t exaggerating. This week I’ve been consumed with studying and practice tests for next week’s exams.

I’ve been pretty stressed and don’t have time to write a proper newsletter, so for this week’s issue I brought out an article from the vault: The Pros and Cons of [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). This article has a similar model to [Austin Scholar #5: Knowing Knewton](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-5-knowing-knewton?s=w) and the “Working the Program” section goes through examples of me actually going through Khan, which is substituting the anecdote for this week.

Please remember to support your high schoolers this month!

### The Pros and Cons of Khan Academy

Everyone knows about Khan Academy. Sal Khan made a name for himself as the leading innovator in online learning and mastery-based learning.

Surprisingly, though, in my experience, Khan Academy is actually not one of my favorite apps. While apps such as [Outlier](https://www.outlier.org/) were built completely focused on online learning, Khan Academy focused on making sure that the app was able to align with a teacher’s lessons. For students who are learning without teachers, this caused the quality of Khan Academy to decrease and made other apps much better choices for online learning.

### Overview

*Though Khan Academy provides many courses and subjects, I will focus on Khan Math, as I have spent the most time in the math courses.*

**Comprehensiveness: 5/10**

Comprehensiveness measures the app's ability to cover all of the necessary content in a course. In my experience, Khan Academy teaches overall concepts and ideas, not individual problems and applications. Even if I completed a Khan math course to 100%, I would not be able to score above a 90% on a state-issued Credit by Examination (CBE) test for the same course. The holes in the content cause the comprehensiveness score to decrease.

**Adaptiveness: 4/10**

Adaptability measures how well the app adjusts the content shown to a student based on what that student knows. While Khan includes many methods of testing the students and ensuring they know the content, it is extraordinarily easy to game the system. (See: #1 Weakness)

**Place in Sequence: 2nd App**

In [A High Schooler's Guide to Reaching the 99th Percentile](https://www.austinscholar.com/blog-1/a-high-schoolers-guide-to-reaching-the-99th-percentile), I explained the importance of sequencing apps, or completing multiple apps for each course. As Khan Academy scores higher on adaptiveness and lower on comprehensiveness, it is best suited to be a second app.

**#1 Weakness:**

* From an objective standpoint, Khan Academy's worst feature is how easy it is to **"memorize your way to mastery."** While this can lead to students completing Khan Academy courses at an incredibly fast rate, the students are less inclined to learn the content. The way Khan is set up allows a student to memorize the answers to each problem by clicking through the questions, and, after a couple of minutes, input the memorized answers as the same questions cycle through. Additionally, some of the question formattings can lead students to memorize *what the answers are* instead of *how to find the answers.* (See: Working the Program)

**#1 Strength:**

* **Khan Academy requires attention to detail.** For each question, it is pertinent that answers are inputted correctly, as one mistake could lead to hours of extra work. To reach 100% mastery on Khan, a student has to answer every single question correctly. This means that one incorrect answer on a Unit Test requires students to re-do the initial lesson to proficiency and then to re-take the Unit Test. For some, this process leads to a complete understanding of a topic. For others, though, it leads to hours of unnecessary work as punishment for typing "89" instead of "98."

A quick side note: While Khan Academy is most well-known for its videos, I find them super boring and slow, and will skip through them when I’m working through the app. That is why I don’t see them as a strength of the app, but I’m sure that others can find the videos at least a little bit helpful.

### Working the Program

(If you’re not a student, feel free to jump to “What Should I Do If I’m Stuck?”)

When first logging onto a Khan Academy course, a "Course Challenge" notification appears. The Course Challenge is an assessment that allows students to test out of content they already know. For example, if a student answered a question on reflecting functions correctly, they would not have to spend unnecessary time working through the lesson on reflecting functions. The Course Challenge allows for less time to be wasted in the course.

*Above: Example Course Challenge Pop-Up*

Also provided in Khan Academy math courses are "Get Ready" courses. If a student feels that they do not know the fundamentals needed to understand PreCalculus, they can click the blue "Get ready for PreCalculus" link accessible at the top of the page. Furthermore, the launch page for each course is a great way to check overall progress. On the left-hand side is the overall completion percentage with individual progress bars for each unit underneath. This provides the student with a clear understanding of where they are in the course.

*Above: Example Khan Academy Launch Page*

Each Khan Academy unit is separated into concepts, which are further broken down into lessons. Each concept provides a list of resources (videos and articles) to explain the concept before beginning any lessons. Though not required, the resource list can be very helpful.

*Above: Example Khan Academy Unit*

When first starting a lesson, if a student does not know how to solve the problem, Khan Academy videos are provided under "Related content." Though the video doesn't always align with the problem, it usually helps with an understanding of the overall concept. Additionally, hints are available.

To count a question as "correct," it must be done correctly FIRST TRY. Any further attempts will not count as a correct question.

Even after getting a question correct, a step-by-step answer explanation can be found by clicking either "See step-by-step solution" or "See how we answered this question."

*Above: Example Khan Academy Correct Question*

In the above question, instead of learning how to solve the problem, I could have simply noticed the pattern that all I had to do was look for 45 (or any provided number) in the second row and input the answer above it (35). This is one of many instances that Khan can be mastered through memorization, not learning.

In order to reach proficiency in a lesson, you must get three questions correct without clicking for hints. One question can be either incorrect or be given a hint.

*Above: Example of a Proficient Lesson (4 Questions Correct)*

If the provided video does not completely explain a concept or you are still confused, Khan Academy has hundreds and thousands of YouTube videos that explain each concept in multiple ways. As I mentioned, I’m not the biggest fan of these videos, but I can’t *not* include Khan’s videos in an article about Khan.

Once each lesson has reached proficiency, it is time to take either the Mastery Challenge or the Unit Test! These short assessments, when answered 100% correctly, allow the lessons to level up from "Proficient" to "Mastered."

*Above: Khan Academy Unit Test and Mastery Challenge Example*

Once 100% is reached on the Unit Test and all of the Quizzes, each lesson will gain the crown and will say "Mastered." Each individual lesson must be Mastered to reach 100% on the course.

*Above: "Mastered" Lessons Example*

**Disclaimer: To reach 90% Mastery of the Khan Academy course, not every single lesson needs to be at 100%.** In my experience, the difference between Khan's 90% and 100% lies in more question memorization, not achieving true mastery.

### What Do I Do If I’m Stuck?

A Callback To [Austin Scholar #5: Knowing Knewton](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-5-knowing-knewton?s=w)

The number one question or worry of students and parents when using apps is “What do I do if I get stuck and there isn’t a teacher to ask for help?”

For math, here is the 3 step “unstick” plan.

1. Review the written explanations and watch the videos the app provides. (Click the Help Button)
2. [Brainly.com](http://brainly.com/) and[WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) are great math-help-resources (See “Scholar’s Sources” for more information).
3. Finally, simply Google the learning objective or topic to access numerous resources, websites, and videos on how to solve that type of problem.

### One Last Tip

The best way to overcome Khan Academy's weaknesses is to take the course seriously, put in the time, and try to learn and master each concept. While clicking through the questions can seem *very* appealing (Trust me– I know), when the clicked-through-content appears in exams or later app work and you have to spend hours actually learning the content to pass a course, you will wish you spent those extra minutes in Khan Academy. **Take notes, read the explanations, and sit down and work. Results will come.**

### Scholar’s Sources

The following sources are all studies conducted that all asked a variety of the same question: Does Khan Academy actually work?

I found the results of these studies to be mixed, but a general consensus was that Khan aided in helping kids understand basic concepts, but was not as helpful in teaching the more challenging concepts ([Source B](https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2528&context=isp_collection)).

I thought that these sources could help show that, even though Khan is not one of the best apps (Comprehensive & Adaptable), the app still teaches math with the same or higher proficiency than a teacher ([Source A](https://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2984/4221)), and even increase their test scores by 16% ([Source C](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/sproject_attachments/w241_final_report_does_khan_work.pdf)).
