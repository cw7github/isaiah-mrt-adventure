### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. How Alpha kindergarten became a top 0.01% program in America
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

By the time you’re reading this, I’ll be on a plane going to London! For the next week, I’m working on a super secret project with [David Perell](https://perell.com/) and his team, and I can’t wait to share what I learn with y’all. I’ve traveled quite a bit – a lot of it by myself – but this is definitely going to be a new experience: nine days in the UK working on a project that will take me all around London pretty much by myself. It will absolutely test my international travel-savviness. But I truly can’t wait for this experience, and I’ll have some down time to explore, so if you have any recommendations on things to do or places to eat please let me know!

### How Alpha kindergarten became a top 0.01% program in America

I started at Alpha in the 3rd grade. When Alpha first started, it didn't have a kindergarten. Everyone – the founders included – believed five and six -year-olds were too young for the 2 Hour Learning model (learning all academic content with apps and AI tutors that use personalized learning plans and spaced repetition to ensure mastery over all concepts, allowing students to fly through the material in just 2 hours per day). But Alpha now has been running Kindergarten for several years and I thought I would look in to see how it is going.

My reaction? Wow – Alpha has come so far in the last decade. It may sound like a proud alum bragging, but I can’t help it.

What is it like today? Alpha kindergarten and first grade are so phenomenal it's honestly hard to see this and not hope this is the future of education. These programs launch kids on their academic journey in a way that's nothing short of extraordinary. Every single kid achieves top 1% performance on nationwide exams. They're taught to have a growth mindset from day one and develop this infectious, optimistic, can-do attitude. And they accomplish all this through a carefully crafted set of workshops that completely transforms their parents' perception of what their kids are capable of achieving.

Here’s what Alpha teaches its kindergarten and first grade students:

**Love of school (yes, really)**

This is an important starting point, because I know what you're thinking. Alpha often talks to parents about this directly: “You're probably worried that because of these insane achievements and expectations, you'd be putting your little kid into some stress-induced pressure cooker environment. But that couldn't be further from the truth.

When you meet Charity, Mallory, and Malu ( three of our kindergarten guides) and witness how they wrap your kids in genuine love and care, you realize you're looking at the greatest kindergarten teachers in the world. These women have cracked the code on making rigorous learning feel like the most natural, joyful thing a child could be doing.

But here's what's going to happen to your daughter (and yes, this story gets told over and over). Sometime in the first 90 days, you're going to pick up your little bundle of love, and as you drive home, she'll start crying. You'll immediately spiral into panic mode, thinking to yourself: *Is this environment too intense? Are they pushing her too hard? Did I make a terrible mistake?*

But between those sobs, your 6-year-old will whisper: "Mommy, why can't we go to school on Saturday?" And that's the moment you'll know Alpha is exactly the right place for your kid.”

**Our academic performance**

The academic data from Alpha kindergarten and first grade truly speaks for itself. This is what the graph and summary from the nationwide NWEA MAP test results report looks like:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4W3d!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb22b40ed-b286-458e-b05c-64cefb249c9a_1294x420.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4W3d!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb22b40ed-b286-458e-b05c-64cefb249c9a_1294x420.png)

Looking at this MAPs test data, these results are absolutely extraordinary. Let me break down what you're seeing here:

That scatter plot shows four zones based on achievement vs. growth:

* **Bottom left (pink)**: Low achievement, low growth - struggling students
* **Top left (tan)**: Low achievement, high growth - catch-up mode
* **Bottom right (yellow)**: High achievement, low growth - coasting gifted kids
* **Top right (green)**: High achievement, high growth - the holy grail

Every single Alpha student (those purple squares and crosses) is clustered in that top-right green zone. This literally never happens. Most schools have students scattered across all four quadrants because that's... normal. Alpha has achieved something that defies educational statistics.

**100% Met or Exceeded Projected Scores:** In both math and reading, every single student hit or surpassed their individual growth targets. This is statistically impossible at scale. Even the best schools typically see 80-90% of students meeting projections.

**222% and 195% of Projected Growth:** Alpha students didn't just meet their growth targets, they obliterated them. They learned more than twice as fast as the sophisticated algorithms predicted they would. This suggests the learning environment is so optimized that it's accelerating development beyond what standardized models consider possible.

**99th and 97th Percentile Growth:** The median student at Alpha is growing faster than 97-99% of all students nationwide. This means even Alpha's "average" performers are growing at rates that would make them standouts at any other school.

And remember: they are doing all of this in just two hours every day.

I took this data and uploaded them to Claude 4-Opus deep research, submitting this prompt: "Provide deep academic insights. Compare these students to the students at the best schools in the USA." Here’s a link

to the [full results](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BaPuYQSBaMvqvFOxme3fULrOLq0Kxh0gAfNPi_xEixA/edit?usp=sharing) (the original MAP results have students’ names, so I had to create a new document of just the Claude report). But if you don't want to read the whole analysis, here are some excerpts that'll blow your mind:

*"Alpha Austin has achieved performance that places it not just among the top schools in America, but in a category that may require redefining what constitutes exceptional educational achievement."*

*"Alpha Austin's Spring 2024-2025 student achievement data represents statistically extraordinary performance that places the school in the top 0.1% of institutions nationally. With 100% of students meeting projected RIT scores and growth rates exceeding 200% of projections, these results demonstrate outcomes typically achieved by fewer than 1 in 1,000 schools across the United States."*

*"Alpha Austin's achievement data represents a statistical outlier that challenges fundamental assumptions about educational outcomes and student capability. The combination of 100% projected score achievement, 200%+ growth rates, and 99th percentile learning acceleration achieved across an entire student population without selective admission creates a new benchmark for educational effectiveness."*

**Life skills workshops**

Here's the beautiful thing about AI-powered personalized learning: because of the precision of personalization and mastery-based progression, it allows kids to master their academics in just 2 hours a day. So what should these tiny humans do with their free afternoons? Learn actual life skills.

This is revolutionary because life skills typically aren't taught to young kids. Most adults assume children aren't capable of handling real responsibilities or complex tasks. But they absolutely are, and Alpha's students prove it every single day.

Here are some examples of workshops these kindergarteners and first graders have tackled and the mind-blowing things they've accomplished (with videos attached):

* Completing grit workshops (which challenge their ability to push through something hard). Just a few of the tough things our kindergarteners and first graders have done:

  + [Pedal power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNVKlZ8Rcto) (ride a bike 5 miles without stopping)
  + Kicks club (choose an advanced soccer skill and fail 200 times without giving up)
  + [Climb quest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGdOQwpE_94) (climb a 40 ft rock wall)
  + Mission Swimpossible (swim independently in the deep end)
* [World Changers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHUg4jNdx9s): Students raised enough money to give someone clean water for life. This was big for character building because kids were suddenly empowered to make a difference when they notice a problem, no matter how big (this workshop hit both financial literacy and public speaking because the kids delivered a mock Ted Talk for the project)
* [AI imagineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGBJHdjhZg): Students explored hobbies independently with AI
* Better Together: Kids learned to play board games fairly – which the kids loved because of the games, and parents loved because of the direct instruction on socialization skills

These kids are doing things that I struggle with now, and it’s crazy for me to imagine doing them ten years ago. The students are inspiring me to continue to raise my personal bar, and they’re also raising the bar on what I believe it’s possible for kids to achieve. When you give kids the tools, the structure, and the self-confidence to handle real challenges, they don't just meet expectations – they obliterate them.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [How to Invest: Masters on the Craft](https://www.amazon.com/How-Invest-David-M-Rubenstein/dp/1982190302?adgrpid=185328955904&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=748008426930&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13815888884250628595&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9060225&hvtargid=dsa-1595363597442&hydadcr=&mcid=&hvocijid=13815888884250628595--&hvexpln=67&tag=googhydr-20&hvsb=Media_d&hvcampaign=dsadesk)

I’ve spent the last week reading 1,000 pages about investing every day. (Yes, my eyes are exhausted every night and I’ve begun to hear the phrase “most people should just put their money in an index fund” in my sleep.) The above book by David Rubenstein (co-founder of Carlyle Group, worth billions) is my favorite. He basically used his ridiculous Rolodex to interview 20+ of the world's most successful investors. You get *massive* value from pretty much every page.

Each chapter is a polished interview with legends like Larry Fink (BlackRock's $10 trillion empire), Seth Klarman (the value investing wizard), Stanley Druckenmiller (macro trading genius), and crypto billionaire Mike Novogratz.

**Overall lessons you learn:**

* Each investor found their niche (real estate, tech, emerging markets) and became obsessed with understanding it better than anyone else
* Most top investors were intensely curious kids who loved reading and solving puzzles
* The technical stuff isn't that hard – it's controlling your emotions and knowing when to sell that separates pros from amateurs

Overall, this book is incredible because you get inside the minds of people who moved billions of dollars and shaped global markets. Their stories reveal patterns – intellectual curiosity, resilience after failures, willingness to go against conventional wisdom, and an almost obsessive work ethic.

Things that I learned: Endowments? Not for me. Crypto? Not for me. Distressed debt? Not for me. These stories showed me that there are some investing strategies that really don’t play to my strengths or abilities, and helped me clarify my focus. Definitely a home run.

2. [Investing in Stocks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCXF2TMP?ref=KC_GS_GB_US)

This is the book for anyone who's ever looked at the stock market and thought "I have no idea what I'm doing." Paul Mladjenovic, a certified financial planner with 25+ years of experience, wrote an extremely simplified guide to understanding how to think about investing.

Mladjenovic's Core Framework:

* Start with the basics: Understand what you actually own when you buy a stock (hint: it's a piece of a real company, not just numbers on a screen)
* Research before you buy: Learn to read financial statements, understand market cap, and evaluate a company's health before investing
* Diversification is key: Don't put all your eggs in one basket – spread risk across different sectors, company sizes, and even asset types
* Know your goals: Are you investing for growth, income, or preservation? Your strategy should match your timeline and risk tolerance

Unlike dense academic texts, this book actually teaches you *how* to do things. Want to know how to read a balance sheet? There's a step-by-step breakdown. Confused about the difference between growth and value stocks? Mladjenovic explains it like you're having coffee with a knowledgeable friend.

However, the "For Dummies" format means lots of repetition and basic explanations that might feel elementary if you already know some investing basics. Overall, this was another good starter for me – it’s helped me establish my bearings in all the rest of the investing books I’m reading.

3. [The Thursday Murder Club](https://www.amazon.com/A-Thursday-Murder-Club-Mystery-5-book-series/dp/B08RDVHNTB)

Aside from all of those investing books, I have still been reading for fun, too. One of the most entertaining books I’ve read in a while is *The Thursday Murder Club*, a story about a group of retirees who are obsessed with solving crimes – and can’t wait to unravel the mystery when a crime happens right in front of their eyes. I won’t say too much because I don’t want to spoil anything, but this is absolutely worth the read if you like murder mysteries.
