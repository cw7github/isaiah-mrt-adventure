### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Everyone is *wrong* about motivation (& why extrinsic motivation beats intrinsic motivation)
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

As David Perell revealed in [his X post](https://x.com/david_perell/status/1940146825681674417), the project I’ve been working on is a documentary starring [The Cultural Tutor](https://x.com/culturaltutor?lang=en) on why we don’t make beautiful things anymore. Working on the film set and experiencing London through this lens was a truly magical experience, and I can’t wait to tell you more about it next week, so stay tuned for that!

For this week’s newsletter, I’m going to be talking about one of the core parts of Alpha and 2 Hour Learning: motivation. Online, adaptive, AI-powered apps might be life-changing, but if you can’t get a kid to put in the work, they’re useless. Motivation is what makes our system work.

### Everyone is *wrong* about motivation (& why extrinsic motivation beats intrinsic motivation)

If you've spent any time in education circles, you've heard the gospel of intrinsic motivation. The basic belief system goes like this:

Intrinsic motivation (doing something because you inherently enjoy it) is pure, noble, and sustainable. Extrinsic motivation (doing something for external rewards like money, grades, or recognition) is corrupting, shallow, and ultimately counterproductive.

This belief is supposedly backed by decades of research, most famously Edward Deci's 1971 studies where college students lost interest in puzzle-solving after being paid to do it, and Mark Lepper's research showing that children who were promised rewards for drawing became less interested in drawing during free time.

The overjustification effect – where external rewards supposedly undermine intrinsic motivation – has become education dogma. School programs that provide money or prizes for reading books have been criticized for their potential to reduce intrinsic motivation. Teachers are told to avoid external rewards whenever possible.

But here's the thing: I think this research has led us to the wrong conclusions about how motivation actually works in practice.

My Spiky POV: Extrinsic motivation dominates (and that's okay)

After four years at Alpha School and now at Stanford, I've come to believe that extrinsic motivation is not only more powerful than we give it credit for – it's actually the dominant force behind most high achievement. And rather than corrupting intrinsic motivation, thoughtful extrinsic rewards can enhance and channel it.

Here's why I think the conventional wisdom is wrong:

At Alpha, where students complete their academics in just two hours a day using AI-powered adaptive educational apps, we've seen something fascinating happen. Because academic learning becomes so efficient, our [guides](https://alpha.school/guides/) don't spend time on lesson-planning. Instead, they spend their time getting to know each individual student and figuring out what motivates them.

For some kids, it's money – they'll work incredibly hard if they can earn spending money for achieving goals. For others, it's pursuing specific achievements related to their passions. Some are motivated by extra social time with friends. Others by small treats or privileges.

The key insight: the guides spend enormous time personalizing these extrinsic motivators for each kid. They don't assume one size fits all. They observe, experiment, and adjust.

Now, I would consider myself highly intrinsically motivated. I genuinely love learning, writing this newsletter, and pursuing intellectual challenges. But here's what I've noticed about myself and my similarly driven friends:

Our intrinsic motivation has never disappeared despite receiving tons of external rewards.

I got paid to write this newsletter. I received recognition for my SAT scores. My friends who are also high achievers have been awarded throughout their lives for academic and personal accomplishments.

According to the overjustification effect, we should have lost our intrinsic drive. But we haven't. If anything, the external validation and rewards have reinforced our internal motivation by showing us that what we're doing has value.

My sister is a perfect example of why the "intrinsic only" approach fails. She's not naturally drawn to academic learning the way I am. Without external motivators, she would likely do the minimum required.

But with the right extrinsic rewards – personalized to what actually matters to her – she accomplishes incredible things. I always go back to the story of when she *really* didn’t want to learn fractions and explained how useless the work she was doing was. However, the head of school knew that she wanted to be a fashion designer and he explained that, if she truly wanted to be a fashion designer, she needed to know how to use fractions. He knew my sister so well to say the exact thing that she needed to go on.

Even as time went on, though, she held the belief that she just wasn’t good at math. But she was motivated by money. The solution? Tell her that she could have $1,000 if she reached the 99th percentile nationwide in math in her grade level. She accomplished it the next year. These external motivators allowed her to work through mental blocks and achieve things that she didn’t believe to be possible. The external motivation doesn't corrupt some pure internal drive; it creates a drive that wouldn't otherwise exist.

I think the classic motivation studies got something fundamentally wrong: they used rewards that were too small and impersonal.

If a kid was going to mow a lawn for free, they probably feel like they're doing a huge service. However, if you offer to pay them $10 to do so, the value of mowing the lawn likely goes down and they won't care enough to do it for free.

The problem isn't that extrinsic rewards destroy intrinsic motivation. The problem is that we're not making the extrinsic rewards meaningful enough or personal enough.

When researchers give kids a generic "good player" certificate for drawing, they're not creating a meaningful reward system. They're creating a token that signals the activity only has value if someone else says so.

But when Alpha guides spend weeks figuring out that one student is motivated by earning money for a specific goal, while another is motivated by recognition from peers, while a third is motivated by extra time pursuing their passion project – that's a completely different kind of extrinsic motivation.

Let's be honest about how the adult world actually works:

* Entrepreneurs are motivated by financial success and recognition
* Scientists are motivated by grants, publications, and professional recognition
* Artists are motivated by sales, exhibitions, and critical acclaim
* Athletes are motivated by wins, records, and sponsorships

Yes, most of these people also have intrinsic passion for their work. But the extrinsic motivators don't diminish that passion – they channel and amplify it.

Research has shown that offering positive praise and feedback when people do something better than others can improve intrinsic motivation. The key is that the external rewards need to reinforce competence and provide meaningful feedback.

Instead of avoiding extrinsic motivation, schools should get much better at it:

Personalization is everything. The same reward that motivates one student will demotivate another. Schools need to invest time in understanding individual students deeply.

This is why the Alpha model works so well. When you can deliver academic content efficiently through AI, you free up the teachers’ time for the much more complex work of understanding and motivating individual students.

The motivation research that dominates education was mostly done on college students doing artificial tasks in laboratory settings. Real motivation in the real world is more complex and more contextual.

I'm not saying intrinsic motivation doesn't matter – it absolutely does. But I am saying that thoughtful, personalized extrinsic motivation is far more powerful and less harmful than conventional wisdom suggests.

The students I know who achieve the most are motivated by everything: internal curiosity, external recognition, future goals, present rewards, social connection, individual achievement, and more.

It's time we stopped treating extrinsic motivation like a necessary evil and started treating it like a powerful tool that, when used skillfully, can help students achieve things they never thought possible.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Astral Codex Review on Alpha School and 2 Hour Learning](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-review-alpha-school)

If you haven’t seen it already, I highly recommend reading this review of the Alpha program. It’s a massive, 20-page first-hand account of the pros and cons of 2 Hour Learning and what it does for your kid. If you have questions about Alpha from reading my newsletter or the review, I also recommend that you scroll through the comment section. There are over 600 comments tackling a ton of Alpha’s FAQs and both Alpha parents and staff are in it answering questions. If you have any further questions or want clarifications, please feel free to reach out to me or reply to this newsletter.

2. [When Genius Failed](https://www.amazon.com/When-Genius-Failed-Long-Term-Management/dp/0375758259)

This is one of the scariest investing books I’ve ever read, and I now believe it should be required reading before anyone – particularly people who consider themselves “smart” or “a genius” – is allowed to begin investing. Lowenstein tells the story of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund run by literal Nobel Prize winners that nearly destroyed the global financial system in 1998.

Even the smartest people in the world – including economics Nobel laureates Robert Merton and Myron Scholes – can be spectacularly wrong when they combine mathematical arrogance with massive leverage. LTCM thought they had "solved" risk using computer models, then lost $4.6 billion in a matter of weeks.

LTCM was founded by John Meriwether (a legendary Salomon Brothers trader) with Nobel Prize winners and finance PhD's who created the mathematical models that Wall Street still uses. The fund generated 40%+ annual returns for the first few years, making the partners ridiculously wealthy and attracting $100+ billion in assets. However, as they got more and more successful, they also got more and more arrogant. They ended up using 30-to-1 leverage (borrowing $30 for every $1 of capital) based on models that assumed markets would behave perfectly “rationally”. So when Russia defaulted in 1998 (something the models didn’t think was “rational”), correlations went to 1.0 (everything fell together), their "diversified" positions all lost money simultaneously, and the fund imploded. The Federal Reserve had to organize an emergency bailout because LTCM's collapse threatened to take down every major bank on Wall Street.

This book shows how genius-level intelligence becomes dangerous when combined with hubris and leverage. The partners genuinely believed their models had eliminated risk, not just measured it.

3. [Vanderpump Rules](https://www.bravotv.com/vanderpump-rules)

I have some bad news (for my productivity, mostly): I have found my new favorite reality TV show. Vanderpump Rules is peak 2010s messy, unfiltered reality television and I’m truly obsessed.

I’m sure a lot of people (my dad included) wonder why I enjoy watching this type of TV show while I’m also spending my summer reading 1,000 pages of investing books per day and writing about how to transform K-12 education. The honest truth is that I simply find *people* fascinating. One of the core cast members, Jax Taylor, doesn’t feel remorse for messing up and cheating on every single girl he’s dated. Another was depressed and heartbroken for two seasons straight, then claimed she found peace and goodness in her life by leaving the show and the other cast members, yet she continues to come back for each new season (for fame and fortune, presumably). Another believes she can sing, which is the biggest delusion of them all. I just love watching these people interact with each other and figure out new ways to be cruel, to make each other laugh, to become friends again… to be human in the only ways they know how.

So although these shows are pretty “trashy”, I feel like I learn a lot about *people*, how to treat others and react to different situations, and how not to.
