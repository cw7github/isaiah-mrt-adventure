### **Hey, y'all!**

Welcome back to the Austin Scholar newsletter! At the time I sent out this newsletter, I was still working on getting my Substack reinstated, but that did not hinder my writing. I continued to send weekly newsletters from Austin Scholar, and now that I am sixteen I am able to re-publish those newsletters onto Substack. Apologies for the inconvenience and I thank you for your support and patience.

Today from Austin Scholar...

1. Teenagers Need To Take Control Of Their Education
2. Three sources that compile the best ideas on education from today’s leading thinkers

> Also– At the end of the article, I have an action plan for parents and a call to action for teens.  If your teen has specific questions on how to get started, feel free to email them to me. I know it is a little daunting at first.

### Teenagers Need To Take Control Of Their Education

For six years, I passively sat in a classroom, letting teachers tell me what to do. I wasn’t motivated to improve because I didn’t have control or power over my situation. I only learned what I was told to, and that was enough. I didn’t care about improving the quality of my educational experience.

When I moved to [Alpha](https://alpha.school/) in the fifth grade, I learned to be in control of my education. I've been able to set my own academic goals and milestones and figure out the most effective ways to motivate myself, such as rewards or short breaks. This has been possible because my sister and I grew up with the idea that age and responsibility should increase proportionally.

When my sister and I were young, our parents held our hands and taught us how to form effective habits and learn basic life skills. As we got older, though, our parents began to let go of our hands and we learned to live independently. This allowed for my sister and me to be prepared for the "real world," where there will not be an adult telling us what to do and how to act at every moment.

A significant portion of my life that I've been taught to be in control of is my education. My parents and teachers held my hand as I was taught how to set goals and focus on academics. Once I was confident in my abilities, they let go of my hands.

Stanford University researcher [Dr. Albert Bandura](https://www.hmhco.com/blog/do-students-have-control-over-the-outcome) found that when students feel as though they have power and control in their education, they become more motivated to make an impact in their academic life. This is why it is so important for the kids to set their own academic goals instead of having the parents nag their kids and force them to do their homework. Letting the students take control empowers them to make a difference in their lives.

**What is being in control of your education?**

Being in control of my education is having complete power over what I learn and when I learn it. Through Alpha, I have been fortunate to have the experience of using online apps, such as Knewton and Khan Academy, to learn. These apps allow for each student to learn at their own pace, which enables having control over my education.

When I was in the eighth grade, I wanted to finish Algebra II before the end of the school year so that I could start high school in Pre Calculus. I knew that I had around ninety lessons to complete, and was given one hour in the school day to work on math. If each lesson took me two hours and I had 140 school days before my deadline, then I needed to do one-and-a-half lessons per day, which is around two hours of work at home. Because of the power I had over my education, I was able to take the information I had and use it to meet my goals.

I finished Algebra II three weeks early and started Pre-Calculus before my freshman year of high school.

I wouldn’t have had the same drive and motivation to achieve this goal if I had only been doing it because my parents told me to.

Not only will being in control of their education help teenagers grow academically, students having agency over their education will encourage personal growth through life skills and self-discovery.

One of the most important life skills I have learned through having ownership over my education is creating habits. I began to do two hours of focused, intense schoolwork from 4:30 to 6:30 every day. This allowed me to practice consistency in my learning and helped with learning how to set challenging, but manageable goals.

Goal setting was another incredibly useful life skill I learned. Ownership over my education meant that I was given an end goal (finishing Algebra II, for example), and I had to figure out how I was going to achieve this goal. I learned how to set weekly goals that, if I accomplished, would allow me to meet my end goal. **Beginning to set goals from a young age gave me insights into what my personal limits are.** Through trial and error, I realized how far I could push myself while still producing high-quality results. Time management also went hand-in-hand with building habits and goal setting.

Even though most students don't live in Austin or go to Alpha, there is still a way to help your child have control over their education.

**Start setting goals**

Because setting goals is the basis of your kid’s power over their education, the first step is to sit down with your child and discuss their goals–both academic and personal. **Make sure, though, that you are discussing your** ***child’s*** **goals, not your goals for your child.** Then, find ways to help the academic goals align and complement the personal goals. For example, my sister always wanted to be a fashion designer, but absolutely hated math. When she realized that she had to master fractions and measurements to even *think* about achieving her dream, she was quick to get to work on math. Try and figure out how to make academics less of a chore, and more of a necessity to meet goals and achieve dreams.

**To close, a message to the kids:**

> **Wake up.** Do not accept passively sitting while adults drone on and on and try to manage your life. Remember: It’s your life, and you need to take charge. Talk about your dreams and goals, and find resources to help you get there. Use Coursera, Masterclass, and Khan Academy to dive deep into your interests. Read books and articles. Follow Twitter experts. Take control over your education. Take control over your life.

A great book on this topic is The [Self-Driven Child](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Driven-Child-Science-Giving-Control-ebook/dp/B072KBWB6G/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1647612236&sr=8-1).  I will have a full post on it in the future, but this link is for those of you in the fast-reader group who want to get a head start. This book contains great insights on what parents’ roles are, explores false assumptions about kids and school, and provides clear action-items for parents.

“Our role as adults is not to force them [kids] to follow the track we’ve laid out for them; it’s to help them develop the skills to figure out the track that’s right for them.” –Dr. William Stixrud (a neuropsychologist) and Ned Johnson, authors of *The Self-Driven Child*
