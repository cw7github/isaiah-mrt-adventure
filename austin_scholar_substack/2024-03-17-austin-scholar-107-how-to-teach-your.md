### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: Why I find skiing so fun
2. How to teach your kid to have a growth mindset
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

Happy spring break everyone!! I hope y’all have had as much fun as I did. I got to go skiing again – and the best part is that my mom and sister came with me. Normally I just tag along on my best friends’ family trips, but this year I was able to sway my family to come along, with promises of a hot tub and a warm lodge. I skied my heart out – from the moment the lifts opened to the last chair – and it, unfortunately, ended with me getting sick :(

So this week’s newsletter is a little short, but I hope it’s still just as useful.

### Austin’s Anecdote: Why I find skiing so fun

I’m obsessed with skiing.

It’s not something I get to do often (since I live in, you know, Austin) but I’m always dreaming about it. And it’s kinda weird that I like it so much.

Because I’m not the world’s best skier and I’m still prone to falling (I have a huge bruise on my knee from this last trip). I make mistakes and sometimes I have bad form when I’m nervous.

And skiing is, like, public. People can watch you mess up. Other skiers on the chairlift can laugh at you when you fall.

And me? I’m not used to doing things I’m not amazing at (thanks to the perfectionist in me). As much as I’m working on it, failing in public is not something I actively look to do.

But when I ski, I go right under the chairlift in perfect view to be judged. I go with people who are ten times better than I am and I still enjoy every moment.

It’s something I just have fun with – and because of that, I’m able to look at my mistakes as something to learn from. Falling doesn’t mean I’m a bad skier, it just means I have more to learn.

(When I was in ski school, my instructor told me about his favorite run on the mountain – the hardest run – that none of us were even allowed to attempt because we weren’t good enough yet. This weekend, I finally did it. I have proof of how much I’ve grown since my ski school years – and know I’ll continue to get better.)

So the question really is: *why do I love skiing so much?*

Because I have a growth mindset about it.

### How to teach your kid to have a growth mindset

Growth mindset: what is it? And how can you teach it?

According to the University of Phoenix, a growth mindset is “the belief that one can learn and grow.” Its opposite is a fixed mindset, which is “the belief that a person’s ability to learn and improve cannot extend beyond a certain point.”

Basically, it’s the difference between “I didn’t do well on that math test, so I’m going to study more for the next one” and “I didn’t do well on that math test, so I must be bad at math”.

Now, how can you teach your kid to have a growth mindset? I have a few recommended steps and strategies:

1. Find a new hobby that’s just for fun

Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, your kid has to start a hobby that they think is fun. For example, they could start a new sport (ice skating, tennis, or something like running they could do on their own), a craft (knitting, sewing, drawing), or something else entirely (playing an instrument, baking sweets, writing poems). It just has to be something that doesn’t have a lot of pressure and they’re genuinely excited about – otherwise these next steps won’t work.

2. Talk through self-reviews

As they start working on their new activity, have them start to look for their own progress.

* What did they learn today?
* What are they planning to work on tomorrow?
* Where can they improve?
* What can they do to improve those areas?
* How can they check to make sure they’ve improved?

Walk through these self-reviews in a *super lighthearted* way. Don’t ask the questions like they’re actually important – let it be casual and chill so your kid will be more likely to be honest. This should feel like a fun way to explore their hobby and share it with you, not like you have any attachment at all to their answers. (If your kid feels like they’re being interrogated or like you’re talking about something important, they’ll probably clam up and give short answers.) One way you could do this is to have a hobby of your own – something you’re reflecting on and they can model off of.

Keep repeating until this process is natural.

And when it becomes natural, this will just be how your kid thinks.

3. Apply the logic to other areas

Now that you’ve incorporated this idea of continuous improvement in one area (an area that feels fun and low-stakes), start to apply the logic to things that actually seem important to your kid – and maybe high-pressure.

Go through the same review process after completing a math test or writing an essay. Hopefully, the process will be so natural at this point that there’s no frustration, but if there is, remind your kid about how they’ve learned and improved and grown in their fun hobby. Show them that they know how to get better at something – and that they can apply the same thought process to different situations.

As this self-review process continues to gain influence in their life, your kid will get closer and closer to that growth mindset.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [How to graduate high school and college in one year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hab7xorie1o)

I came across this – very catchy – YouTube video and immediately thought it was just clickbait. But it wasn’t. This video showcases an extraordinarily motivated student who’s mastered how to learn. It’s genuinely inspiring to watch and could give your kid some ideas on how to get dual credit courses and set themselves up for success early.

2. [Equation-Based Writing](http://equationbasedwriting.com)

Sorry, y’all, I’ve gotta self-promo again. If you missed the last few newsletters, I’m launching a course called Equation-Based Writing, where I’ll teach your STEM kids how to write well (and love writing!!) using what they know best: equations. You know how I use equations to help y’all talk to your kid? Well, it’s their turn to use equations to learn how to communicate their thoughts and ideas. Sign ups for the course (April 6th, 7th, 13th, 14th) are open. I’m super excited about this course and hope y’all are too!

3. [How to have a 75% chance at getting into an Ivy League](https://lu.ma/75percentchance)

If you have a rising 9th or 10th grader and are in the Austin area, check out this event!! It will be held at Alpha High next Sunday and will show your kid what they have to do to get into their dream school. I will be there doing a panel, so please sign up if you have any questions for me or just want to say hi :)

If you want your kid to be excited about coming, let them know that Karl from Mr. Beast’s YouTube channel will be speaking.
