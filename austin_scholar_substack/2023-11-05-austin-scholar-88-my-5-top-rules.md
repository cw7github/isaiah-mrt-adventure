3. Scholar’s Sources: More life skills courses

Breaking news: I got accepted into a university!! No longer can I have any [twisty thoughts](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-34-the-science-of) about not being able to go to college, because I’ve been accepted into the University of Manchester. Very very exciting.

Aside from spending this week stressing out about college acceptances, I’ve been watching the Rangers’ World Series games both in Dallas and on our couch. Baseball remains my favorite way to [bond with my dad](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-70-how-to-intentionally).

I’ll make sure to keep y’all updated on my college decisions!!

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I learned the art of public speaking

Three thousand people heard me speak on my Twitter Space this last week. Three thousand people. Giving a speech. Live.

That’s most people’s nightmare.

But I’ve been doing this since the fourth grade.

I gave my first public speech at the end of my fourth-grade year, just a few weeks after I switched schools. I was trying to earn my Hero’s Interview check (checks were basically just the requirements for graduation), meaning I had to act as one of my “heroes” while the head of school interviewed me in front of all of the students.

I was absolutely terrified.

I already didn’t like talking *with* people I wasn’t super close with (total introvert at heart), and now I had to give an actual talk?! While everyone was watching?!

No thanks.

But I was so motivated to complete my checks that I pushed through it. I got up there (as Coco Chanel, of course) and thought of how amazing it would feel to have done this successfully.

And yes, my answers were stilted and clearly rehearsed, I was shaking, and I messed up two of my answers. But I did it.

And then my journey of public speaking started.

To complete more checks, I gave storytalks dramatizing skiing exploits and TED talks on how to tell when someone’s lying and why we’re actually living in a dystopian novel. Motivated to continue earning checks by giving these speeches, I became more and more confident on stage.

Yeah, I might mess up, but the world didn’t end when I messed up before.

And not only was I getting better at giving official speeches, but these skills I learned – communicating my ideas clearly, speaking confidently, and pausing and pacing my words – started transferring to my day-to-day life.

Whether I’m meeting someone new, pitching my Masterpiece, or arguing with one of my friends about an interpretation of a book, I’ve found myself using these skills.

This all culminated last week on my Twitter Space, where I used everything I learned to interview the best minds in education (including Ana Lorena Fabrega, rebelEducator, David Perell, Austen Allred, and more!!) and give a thirty-minute speech on my beliefs.

It was a lot, but *wow*, it was rewarding. I’m so proud of what I was able to accomplish.

All those years ago, I couldn’t have imagined giving a talk in front of thousands of people. But here I am.

### My 5 top rules for public speaking, plus Elon Musk’s pitching structure

I’d like to start off by saying that public speaking is an art. It’s about connecting with people and communicating effectively, all in a beautifully packaged way.

But, as I often talk about in [my newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/math-is-an-art-writing-is-a-science), “art” can be broken down and learned.

So, here are the five skills for your kid to learn so they can feel confident (and master the art of!) public speaking:

1. **Show up with confidence**

This is definitely the hardest one to explain, but definitely the most important. The audience will be able to tell if you’re scared or struggling, and they’ll just follow you into that headspace.

The best thing to do is to fake it until you make it. Cheesy, yes. Effective, also yes.

Roll your shoulders back, pretend you’re talking to yourself, and talk like you’re Barbie – like every word that comes out of your mouth is incredible.

2. **Engage with the audience**

The key to a good talk is being able to connect – and often that requires being vulnerable. Look around the room as if you’re looking into every single audience member’s eyes. Vary your tone so the audience follows as you experience different emotions throughout the speech. Be open with your body language. Ask them [good questions](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-87-the-importance). Make every audience member feel like you’re talking only to them.

3. **Learn to improvise**

I hate to say it, but you’re going to mess up. And that’s okay. It’s human. You can’t keep from messing up, but you *can* learn how to improvise so you can keep going.

Watch a few videos on improvising, or try out an online course ([this](https://improvclassesandcoaching.com/online-improv-classes/) is one I found that seems pretty cool!!) – just start trying.

4. **Practice**

I know this is cliche, but it’s so important. Practice, practice, practice. Practice your speech until it’s muscle memory – until you can say the words while doing something else. Film yourself practicing and find ways to improve. Practice before bed and right when you wake up.

That way, when you get on stage, you don’t have to focus on the words. You’ll know them.

Just focus on changing people’s lives.

If your kid doesn't have a speech or anything yet, that’s okay. Just help them write an introductory pitch for themselves they can give to adults they meet and want to impress. Then practice that.

5. **Constantly receive feedback**

Receiving feedback on your speeches is by far the most valuable thing you can do. For example, after the first day of my Twitter Space last week, I immediately sat down with my guide and we reviewed my ["game film"](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-36-the-four-skills). We talked through the mistakes I made and what I could do better the next day. And since it was my first time interviewing people, there were a ton of improvements for me to make (ex. having better introductions for my speakers and giving my own insights and context during the interview).

I practiced a *ton* that night and made sure to implement all of the feedback. And the next day, I crushed it. I felt way more confident in how the Space went and could literally hear myself improve. Feedback is a true gift.

If your kid implements these five pieces of advice, they’ll be well on their way in the process of mastering the art of delivering a speech. But what about the structure of a talk? Without a doubt, the best way to write a speech is by using the [Elon Musk pitching structure](https://medium.com/firm-narrative/want-a-better-pitch-watch-this-328b95c2fd0b).

Here’s the summary:

1. Name the enemy: what problem is your speech addressing?
2. Intensify the urgency: why should people care? why now?
3. Paint the promised land: what are you proposing? what’s your solution?
4. Explain away the obstacles: what are potential concerns people might have and how can you get around them?
5. Win them over with evidence: what have you already done? where is your proof that this will work?

Using this structure takes your audience on a journey – and drives home your point in an engaging way.

So, if you want to help your kid write their very first speech, try out this ChatGPT prompt:

*“You are an expert pitch writer writing a 2/5 minute pitch on how [name + one liner]. Be punchy and impactful, but still mature and fit for a high school student. Use the 5-step Elon Musk framework for pitch writing of name the enemy, intensify the urgency, paint the promised land, explain away the obstacles, and win them over with evidence.*

*Name the enemy: [Name your enemy]*

*Intensify the urgency: [What are the main 1-2 pieces of data or stories you want in the pitch?]*

*Painting the promised land: [What will change with your Masterpiece?]*

*Explain away the obstacles: [Obstacles + solutions]*

*Win them over with evidence: [What have you already done?]”*

### Scholar’s Sources: More life skills courses

If you want your kid to have opportunities to learn critical life skills – such as public speaking – check out the [Prequel](https://joinprequel.com/) programs. Prequel gives students the chance to build their first business as well as other job simulations, all to ensure that they’re prepared to thrive after high school. Alpha High does life skills workshops each week through Prequel, and they’re seriously the most helpful hours of the week.

On a similar note, check out the [TKS program](https://tks.world/), which helps students learn the skills to do absolutely insane projects in just a few months. I’ve met some of the TKS kids, and I do have to say that they’re doing great things.

To be specific on public speaking, [this website](https://virtualspeech.com/learn/public-speaking-courses) compiles all of the top public speaking courses that your kid can use to kickstart their journey.
