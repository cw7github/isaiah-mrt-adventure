### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: Why having a growth mindset made me happier
2. The self-belief secret of happiness
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

I had another lovely week of summer: spending copious amounts of time with my friends, figure skating, reading, doing Math Academy, watching baseball games, and being anxious about college. I am really enjoying the lack of serious pressure to do a ton of work (for pretty much the first time ever) and am trying to take advantage of it.

### Austin’s Anecdote: Why having a growth mindset made me happier

As someone who’s gone through a *ton* of therapy, I find myself often thinking about *what makes me happy* – or, better, *what makes me feel fulfilled*.

Over time, I’ve identified a multitude of things that bring a warm glow to my chest and a soft smile on my lips:

* Giving my sister a hug
* Snuggling in my parents’ bed and watching a show with them
* Going to dinner with my friends
* Writing an awesome newsletter
* Landing a jump while figure skating

The list could go on and on. And while I strive to do these things every day and definitely feel happier after, these external activities aren’t the most important source of my life satisfaction.

My deepest fulfillment comes from within.

When I was going through [my hardest time](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-34-the-science-of), even when I was at dinner with my friends or hugging my sister, negative thoughts about myself swirled in my head. I was so stuck in my head that I was distracted from actually living.

Changing how I viewed myself was the number one way I improved my mental health.

That was a slow journey – my thoughts went from “I’m terrible at everything I do” to “I might not be great at some things, but I can be at least okay in others” to “I have strengths and weaknesses, and that’s okay. I can work hard to improve.”

Instead of having a broken, fixed mindset, I thought of myself as someone who could grow and improve and change – someone with an endless number of possibilities in front of her.

I think positively of myself now – I am free from the whirlpool of negative thoughts threatening to drag me down at any moment.

I can actually enjoy most moments of my life because I’m happy with who I am and what I can do.

### The self-belief secret of happiness

Those were a lot of pretty words, but you might be wondering, *how can I replicate this for my kid?*

Well, let’s start with the facts.

[This study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367340715_Most_people's_life_satisfaction_matches_their_personality_traits_True_correlations_in_multi-trait_multi-rater_multi-sample_data) shows that life satisfaction is closely tied to personality traits and the way one views themselves.

This graph showcases the beliefs that lead to both a higher life satisfaction and a lower life satisfaction:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f0IO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949e4952-58c1-42cb-af3e-9e40af80f83f_1600x1183.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f0IO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949e4952-58c1-42cb-af3e-9e40af80f83f_1600x1183.png)

Something else important to note: the larger and bolder statements are said to have a more significant impact on life satisfaction.

Let’s pull out the most important statements:

1. Am good at many things
2. Believe that by working hard a person can achieve anything
3. Take risks
4. Easily apologize when I have been wrong
5. Believe on has special duties to one’s family
6. Likes to visit new places
7. Am an extremely loyal person
8. Respect authority
9. Work on improving myself

If your kid identifies with even half of these nine statements, they are almost guaranteed to have a higher life satisfaction.

*But how do I actually get my kid to believe these things?* you might be wondering.

Let’s dive into the top four most important statements.

1. I am good at many things

Lots of kids measure their skill levels by measuring their academic success. Kids who struggle in multiple subjects often have trouble believing in themselves and their ability to succeed. So if your kid is struggling, have them use an online app like [IXL](https://www.ixl.com/) for thirty minutes per day per subject to catch back up and regain their confidence.

Academically crushing it is a really easy way for kids to start to increase their life satisfaction – because they're reminded of their academic abilities (or their perceived lack thereof) every day.

2. I believe that by working hard a person can achieve anything

A great way to help your kid believe in hard work is to set really, really hard goals together, and then create a really, really awesome reward to [motivate them to succeed](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-41-yes-you-should). Kids are limitless and can achieve so much more than they realize. Bribing them into stretching their abilities can unlock their own belief in their capacity and capability. Even if they don’t achieve their goal (I certainly didn’t fully reach my goals in many of my dad’s challenges), their capacity for what they can do will continue to increase. The goal will force them to work hard and the reward will motivate them to keep going.

3. I’m comfortable taking risks

Being a kid is the perfect time to take risks. As a kid, your risks are safer and more controlled than they are in the adult world. So if your kid asks you about starting a new sport, using their allowance money for a lemonade stand, or asking out their crush, support them to the best of your ability. Give them the space to take risks.

4. I easily apologize when I have been wrong

A huge part of this is being able to give and receive feedback, which I’ve written an [entire newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-76-how-to-help-your) about. This kind of behavior, however, needs to be modeled. You can make a huge impact on your kid by demonstrating your own willingness to apologize whenever you mess up. If you’re ever late, burn food, forget something, or hurt your kid’s feelings, make sure you’re not defensive. Take accountability and apologize quickly. Whatever habits you have with feedback and apologies, your kid will probably pick up. So make sure they’re the right ones.

The miserable mix of the internet, mean teenagers, and crazy hormones can create an echo chamber of self-doubt in a teenager’s head. Helping your teenagers really believe positive statements about themselves can go a long way in building their self-esteem and overall fulfillment.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [One L](https://www.amazon.com/One-Turbulent-Story-Harvard-School/dp/0143119028)

As college continues to get closer, I feel more responsibility weigh on my shoulders – after all, part of the next few years will include deciding what I’m going to do with my life. After some discussions with my parents, I decided to start doing a deep dive into potential career options for after Stanford. To start it all off, my dad found a book called One L, which dives into the life of the first year at Harvard Law School. The author and narrator of the book went to grad school at Stanford and had some super interesting insights about the differences between the culture at Stanford versus Harvard. Overall, I ended up feeling super anxious about what law school would be like, and hopeful that if that’s the path I end up taking, there would be an online app available to help me prepare for the dreaded Socratic discussion interrogations.

2. [The pommel horse hero](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/30/nx-s1-5057146/pommel-horse-stephen-nedoroscik-olympics)

Some of you might know that the US Men’s Olympic Gymnastics team just won its first medal since 2008!! And it’s because of one gymnast: Stephen Nedoroscik, who only competed in *one* event. Why, then, was he even on the team and how could he have secured the medal? Well, the answer’s simple: complete domain expertise. Nedoroscik is a pommel horse specialist – someone so good at pommel horse that he doesn’t participate in any of the other five apparatuses, leaving his other four teammates to cover them. But Nedoroscik’s spot on the team is still critical. He’s put so much effort into his one event that he’s become so far above the other gymnasts, allowing Team USA to gain a significant point advantage in this event. The overall moral of the story? Becoming a true domain expert – the world’s best in one small area – can bring home the gold.

3. [Another baseball redemption story](https://x.com/gessnerjosh/status/1816118586592620840?s=42&t=dnLfnUxpmdxs8dXuvH7k-g)

I *love* a good baseball redemption story – and even [wrote about one myself](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-36-the-four-skills)! I think the dedication that goes into dramatic improvement in a sport is incredibly inspiring – and sometimes all it takes to kickstart it is a visit to a prison :)

I did some more research into how Calhoun actually improved, and as with JD Martinez, it all came down to the swing. He “[made] a slight adjustment to [his] swing because it was way too flat and combine[d] it with better swing decisions.” Getting down to the super fine details about what you’re doing wrong – watching your ‘game film’ – is the best thing you can do to improve. Seek out feedback.
