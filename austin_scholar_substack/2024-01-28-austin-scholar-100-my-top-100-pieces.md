### My top 100 pieces of advice for teens and parents (from 100 newsletters)

Because it’s the 100th newsletter, I thought I’d do something a little different. There’s now a vast amount of content from this newsletter, which could seem overwhelming for someone to work through.

So, this week I’m going to write 100 pieces of advice to help your teenager crush school, life, and all the challenges of growing up.

Each one of these is from a different newsletter (and putting this together was a trip down memory lane).

[Subscribe now](https://austinscholar.substack.com/subscribe?)

My top 100 pieces of advice for teens (and parents of teens):

1. [When you learn through apps](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-1-what-school-do-you) (in 2 hours every day), you can spend the afternoon doing incredible, seemingly-impossible, Olympic-level projects.

6. [Teenagers need to take control of their education.](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-6-teenagers-need-to) You can start by holding your kid’s hand as they begin their education journey, but there comes a time when you need to let them stand on their own.
7. [Teenagers need to learn how to write online.](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-7-teenagers-need-to) Writing online allows teenagers to connect with a wider audience and share their ideas. Their future relies on the internet, so they should prepare for it.
8. [Work harder, not longer.](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-8-work-harder-not) Improve your work ethic by learning how to do deep work, building habits, and giving yourself incentives.
9. [The accounting disaster of sixth grade:](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-9-the-accounting-disaster) Living a balanced life isn’t about spending equal amounts of time on each part of your life, but instead about living life according to your Values Pie Chart.
10. [Let teenagers take naps.](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-10-let-teenagers-take) Don’t call your kid lazy for sleeping in on the weekend. They probably really need it.
11. [Finding your tribe:](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-11-finding-your-tribe) Find people who share similar passions and interests with you and who can motivate you and help you improve.

13. [The pros and cons of Khan Academy:](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-13-the-pros-and-cons) Don't cheat an app even if you can. Taking the easy route burns you in the long run. Take the extra time to actually memorize what it's teaching you.
14. [Even if it’s not your kid…:](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-15-even-if-its-not) True, not every child is affected by poor mental health. Maybe it’s not your kid, but it might be your kid’s best friend, or your best friend’s kid, so make sure you’re prepared to listen and learn.
15. [The secrets to communication:](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-15-the-secrets-to) Teenagers want to be treated with respect. We want to be treated as though we are more than just stupid kids (even if sometimes we are).

[How to help your kid find value in their summer:](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-22-how-to-help-your) To have a productive conversation about your kid’s summer (or anything else), make sure you don’t lecture.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

I truly can’t believe I’ve made it to 100 newsletters. I’ve been reflecting on everything that’s happened during my daily journaling (yes, I’ve kept up with every single one of my New Year’s resolutions) and all I have to say is that it’s been quite the journey.

On another note, since I don’t have an official math course this year, I’ve needed to re-math-ify myself, so here are some things I’ve been reading:

1. [Flatland](https://www.amazon.com/Flatland-Romance-Dimensions-Thrift-Editions/dp/048627263X)

I *loved* this novel. It’s super short, punchy, and very thought-provoking. Basically, the narrator (A Square) talks about life in Flatland (two dimensions) and the politics associated with different shapes. And then, there’s the drama of different dimensions, which gets spicy. (It also sneakily goes into Calculus concepts, which was fun to spot). Fantastic allegorical story that I highly recommend.

2. [Why is algebra so hard?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbqnaoU-3VI)

Half of this TEDTalk is an ad, but I loved the premise: that algebra is hard because it’s the first time when math uses imagination instead of formulas. Most kids don’t realize this, so giving them a mindset shift before they even start algebra could be a huge help.

3. [Math is the hidden secret to understanding the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQElzjCsl9o)

This video had such a beautiful representation of what math and numbers are – and how they can be understood in the real world. So whimsical and engaging to watch.
