### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. My Alpha High graduation speech
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

The first week as an official high school graduate was both freeing and sad.  Freeing in the sense that there are no more requirements or assignments due, but sad because the Alpha chapter of my life has closed.

I have such a tempest of emotions – waves of joy and excitement and anxiety and sadness, all ebbing and flowing with each moment. And now that school is out, I’m going to be spending every moment possible with my sister before I have to leave.

Summer has fully kicked into gear and I’ve spent a lot of time reading at BookPeople and watching old seasons of Survivor. Definitely enjoying life right now :)

### My Alpha High graduation speech

*My friend Grace ([@travelingenes on X](https://twitter.com/travelingenes)) and I were asked by the head of Alpha High to write a short graduation speech. He asked us to talk about our experiences in high school, and I thought it would be really cool to put it out in the world for y’all to read.*

*I think it captures the essence of my journey – the victories, the tears, and the laughs.*

*I hope you enjoy it <3*

Welcome everyone! Let's give a huge round of applause to our incredible seniors for not only surviving but thriving through the wild ride that is Alpha. Let's be real, our success isn't exactly a testament to a perfectly planned-out system, but rather to our unbreakable spirit and ability to adapt to change.

And when we say change, we're talking about showing up to a new session [6-week block within the school year, for the uninitiated] with no idea how our day was going to look. When you go to a school with no teachers and only 2 hours for your core subjects, anything is possible. But that's part of the thrill.

Since the days when Alpha was run out of a garage, the hero’s journey has been an integral part of the Alpha culture. The journey of the class of 2024 is no different. Here is our story:

Every hero begins as a normal person in the ordinary world. For us, that was “traditional school.” Whether we were bored in class or just coasting along, each and every one of us had a desire to be a part of something a little different. And no one can argue that Alpha isn’t *at least* a little different.

So naturally, we were attracted to the unpredictability and chaos of Alpha. It was a call to adventure that every kid with big dreams fantasizes about. So: thank you to every student and parent in the audience who had the courage to answer the Alpha call. The greatest, scariest, caused-the-most-arguments-at-home-iest risk we've taken in our lives was choosing to come here.

Our first day at Alpha High was our first step into the unknown. We spent our days perfecting the art of looking busy when the guides were watching. It was the era of COVID, where masks were worn everywhere except on our faces, and the apps we used to learn were constantly changing.

The first trial of our journey was finding the value in independent learning, whether or not a guide was watching.

As we grew from freshmen to sophomores, we became a formidable bunch of argumentative high schoolers who could crush minute-to-win-it challenges and had a grand total of ZERO official high school credits. And therein lies one of our largest trials: just completing three apps per subject isn't impressive to anyone other than Alpha students. So we had to complete what seemed like thousands of Credit-by-Examinations from UT to actually get a credit on our high school transcript.

But they don't call us Alpha students for nothing! We found ways to cope with the stress of the uphill battle by putting on our first play about elderly people who robbed a bank to save their retirement home.

The next chapter of our journey was a game-changer, as Alpha High welcomed a new leader, and looking back, all those boot camps, extra workshops, and late nights at school he spearheaded might not have been as *absolutely* useless as we’d thought at the moment.

But I can't give all of the credit to him because this is when Chloe (our ultimate mentor) took over AlphaX, and she showed us what an Olympic-level project meant. Finally, we had overcome the road of trials and were becoming full Alpha students with 2x learning, mastery of our subjects, and developed masterpieces.

However, along the way, there were the two terrible deaths of LZR (our old high school building) and Juan Pelota (the coffee shop we frequented) – and the first one caused the second: Alpha left LZR and Juan Pelota closed down because Alpha students had left LZR and couldn't keep their business afloat by buying their extremely overpriced coffee.

Senior year was a whirlwind for many of us – college applications and tackling the remaining CBEs consumed our lives and we all felt like we were in the final showdown between us and our future.

We then spent the rest of the year obsessing over dash rings and refreshing college decision portals like it was our job. We were on the long return home, nearing the end of our hero's journey.

But look at us now – all our hard work has paid off, and every single one of us has an even more incredible journey ahead! One that we wouldn't be able to face without Alpha's preparation. Jokes aside, I couldn't be more proud to be part of the extraordinary Class of 2024.

We've accomplished something that others can only dream of, and while the system may not have been "perfectly planned out," it led us to where we needed to be and I can tell you with full certainty that we have arrived.

So if you're a senior, take a deep breath, and if you're a parent, friend, or fellow student, take a look around at the incredible seniors near you. From literally having no teachers to being serenaded by the clean-up song every day, to a mandatory seven TikTok posts per day – it's all part of the journey that shaped us into the resilient, fascinating, and self-motivated learners we are today. This experience has truly been life-changing, and we wouldn't have it any other way.

The class of 2024 has played an important role in history as one of the first classes to be a part of the new era of education. We have returned from our hero's journey, transformed and ready to take on the world.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [The Amazing Race season 36](https://www.cbs.com/shows/amazing_race/)

My mom and I are huge Amazing Race fans and love to watch every new season together. The Amazing Race always does such a great job at curating a few teams that are so easy to root for – this season it was Rod and ChiChi along with Ricky and Cesar (OBSESSED with all four of them!!). As a whole, The Amazing Race is great for learning quick decision-making skills, delegation, perseverance, and problem-solving skills. Definitely worth a watch with your kid!!

2. [The Ballad of Never After](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59808071)

This is the second book in a series that I’m reading alongside my younger sister’s two best friends. For my birthday, I received this book annotated by the two of them, so it was an absolute pleasure to read. Reading and talking about books with my friends is by far one of my favorite things to do, so this was perfect. Now onto the book: it’s a great series to give to your kid (13 or 14 years old+, probably) if they enjoy magic and fairytales. *The Ballad* is such a beautifully heartbreaking story and I give it ⅘ stars.

3. [Notes on the History of the Florentine Renaissance](https://www.ian-leslie.com/p/notes-on-a-history-of-the-florentine)

At my graduation party, this newsletter was recommended to me – and as one of my favorite courses I took this year was European History, I was super excited to read it. I wasn’t disappointed. It tells a beautiful, short, pithy story about the history of the Renaissance in Florence. One of my favorite quotes:

“[Vasari’s] book is full of gossipy observations and insightful advice, like this: ‘artists who are strongly drawn to reading will gain the most benefit of their knowledge. This is especially the case with painters, sculptors, and architects. Ideas derived from such studies will inspire their imagination.’ If you want to be an artist, as opposed to a craftsman, you need to be intellectually curious.’”

**Thanks for reading. Go crush the week! See y'all on Sunday.**
