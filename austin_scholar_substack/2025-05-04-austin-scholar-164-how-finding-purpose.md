### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. How finding purpose helps solve mental health crises
2. Austin’s Anecdote: Advice from a Stanford freshman
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

First midterm of spring quarter completed! It was multivariable integration, and I’m super happy with how I did. As my CS106A (also known as “intro to CS”) midterm is coming up, I have to keep reminding myself that multivariable integration is *a lot* harder than basic Python and that I should be able to do well on this exam. So I’ve been studying a lot for that – along with my second math midterm that’s next Thursday. Midterm season at Stanford pretty much never ends.

I’ve also been going on a lot of “plates” (short for “platonic dates”) with the Pi Phi (my new sorority!) girls, which I love. Not only am I meeting some incredible people, but I’m also getting a ton of advice for my sophomore year. Spring quarter might have a reputation for being the “fun”, “chill” quarter, but it’s definitely my busiest quarter yet.

### How finding purpose helps solve mental health crises

Middle and high school aren’t just tough – they can also be overwhelming for your kid. Between academic pressure, social stress, and a steady stream of world problems on their phones, it’s no wonder so many teens struggle with anxiety, sadness, and self-doubt.

But here’s a truth we don’t talk about enough: one of the best ways for kids to find purpose and heal is to step outside themselves and heal others.

It’s natural, when your child feels down, to want to comfort them, give advice, or even just let them ride out their feelings. But too much time spent “wallowing” or being trapped in their own head can make things worse. Research and real-world experience show that turning outward is often the key to feeling better.

Research also tells us:

* **Action breaks the cycle.** When teens focus on others’ needs, they interrupt the downward spiral of rumination and negative self-talk.
* **Contribution creates meaning.** Teens who help others discover their life has value far beyond grades or social status—they’re needed, and they matter.
* **Empathy is a superpower.** Supporting friends, classmates, or community members builds emotional intelligence and resilience.

Have you ever noticed that when you're going through something hard (like a tough situation with a friend or a breakup), it's somehow comforting to help a friend with their problems for a while? It distracts you from your own problems, but it also makes you feel valuable and in control of something, instead of being stuck wallowing in your own challenges.

You don’t have to wait for the “perfect moment” or the right mood to be useful – sometimes, the act of helping is what helps your mental state start to change. Here’s how to encourage your teen to look outward:

1. Spot the signs and offer a gentle push

If your child seems withdrawn, irritable, or stuck in a loop of negative thinking, don’t just tell them to “cheer up.” Instead, suggest a concrete way to help someone else:

* "Your aunt has been working extra hours this week and is exhausted. Do you want to help me make dinner to take over so she can have a break?"
* “I’m going to write letters and donate toys to children in the hospital. Would you like to help?”

2. Frame helping as a privilege, not a chore

Teens are motivated when they know their efforts matter. Talk about volunteering or acts of kindness as opportunities:

* “You have a real gift for making younger kids feel welcome. Would you consider being a peer mentor?”
* “Your tech skills could really help the community center with their website.”

3. Start small, but start

If your teen is feeling low, huge commitments can feel overwhelming. Begin with bite-sized acts:

* Write a note of encouragement to a friend
* Collect gently-used clothes for donation
* Offer to tutor a struggling classmate
* Make soup for a sick family member or friend
* Make cookies for their classroom
* Complement people's outfits when they're out and about
* Pay it forward at Starbucks
* Invite someone shy to sit at lunch
* Leave encouraging sticky notes on bathroom stall doors
* Do a small act of service for a family member
* Hold the door for anyone you can

The magic is real: when kids start focusing on others, something shifts inside them:

* **Their mood improves.** Acts of kindness release feel-good brain chemicals—science backs this up!
* **Their perspective widens.** Teens see they’re not alone in their struggles, which reduces feelings of isolation.
* **Their self-worth grows.** Making a difference, even in small ways, reminds kids that their actions count.

As a parent, your involvement matters. Teens might act like they don’t want you around, but modeling service and empathy has a powerful impact. Volunteer together, talk about the “why” behind helping, and celebrate their contributions (not just their achievements).

If your child resists, try to make acts of service a family event. Plan monthly service projects or kindness challenges for you all to do together.

Life gets richer – and mental health gets stronger – when we stop looking inward and start reaching outward. Encourage your teen to get involved, help others, and watch as their sense of purpose and joy grows. Don’t let them get stuck in sadness. Instead, help them discover the meaning and connection that comes from being part of something bigger.

One incredible example of how far you can take this is the inspiring Alpha High student [Alex Mathew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alxmat/) (y’all should look at his LinkedIn – it’s insane), who created [Berry](https://berryplush.com/) (I’m obsessed with the website he built).

Berry is an AI-powered plushie designed to support teens through one of the most emotionally volatile stages of life—not with lectures or generic affirmations, but with real, personalized, daily guidance.

Teens talk to Berry for just five minutes each day about whatever’s on their mind: stress about a test, a fight with a friend, or a feeling they can’t name. In response, Berry speaks back with empathy and clarity, offering tailored advice that’s rooted in who they are and what they need right now.

After each conversation, Berry texts a bite-sized action step—something simple but meaningful—and follows up to ensure follow-through. Over time, those micro-wins compound. Teens start feeling more seen, more in control, more emotionally equipped.

Alex has already done so much work with Berry.

He has:

* Built the proof of concept scrappy prototype (please watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSc8pWw0ApY) video – it is so impressive)
* Spoken at [Web Summit](https://websummit.com/) about Berry, one of the biggest tech conferences in the world
* Gotten validation from huge stakeholders in AI and mental health professionals (Snap, Born This Way Foundation, Sahil Bloom, FOSI, etc.)
* Gotten over $30k in non-dilutive funding
* Worked with developers/designers to build an app wireframe
* Landed a [partnership](https://berryplush.com/pricing) with an influencer, @sloanealex\_ (2 million followers on TikTok and another Alpha High student)

That last one is the most important (at least in the context of this article). Alex has been working to expand this program with other teen influencers – so they can use their platform to get Berry to as many people and impact as many kids’ lives as possible.

This story is so important because it illustrates how far you can go helping others. Alex is spending his time creating a tool that supports people's mental health. He's building an impressive product, but more importantly, he's building his own mental health by being helpful to other people.

### Austin’s Anecdote: Advice from a Stanford freshman

Back with some more advice from my Stanford friends! This week, you’ll hear from [Sarah Mian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahmian1/), someone who also spent their time in high school working to improve the educational experience and outcomes of the people around her. Here’s what she has to say about getting into Stanford:

*Austin Scholar: What do you think made you stand out to admissions officers?*

Sarah: I believe I stood out to the admissions officers because my application told a cohesive story of my identity, my passions, and my community impact. When I received my note from my admissions officer after getting into Stanford, she highlighted one of my recommendation letters which talked about my leadership. My admissions officer wrote that as she read through my application and saw my passion for social justice and advancing educational equity, she saw what my recommenders meant.

It is really important that all of the pieces of your application clearly connect, since supplemental pieces such as letters of recommendation and activities play a huge role in confirming your character and as well as providing a sense of purpose. One of the most meaningful parts of my high school experience was working with my school district LAUSD’s student empowerment unit. Through my essays, I shared how I got passionate about educational advocacy; my extracurriculars and letters were able to back that up by showing evidence of my involvement and impact. Your essays are important in showing your personality, not just your achievements. I really enjoyed sharing what I loved and what made me unique while also sharing how I was able to give back to others. That authenticity is what I believe helped me stand out.

*Austin Scholar: What advice would you give to parents on one thing they can do to help their kid get into a school like Stanford?*

Sarah: One thing parents can do is give their kids constant support to explore their interests and discover their passions during high school. In order to stand out, it helps to be exceptional at something, which is only possible if a student genuinely loves the field. There is no single path to get into college, so following what you truly enjoy and excel at is the most authentic and effective approach. By encouraging exploration and showing trust in your student’s abilities, parents can help build the confidence their kids need to take initiative and pursue ambitious projects. Whether it's starting a nonprofit, conducting independent research, creating art, or launching an app, admissions officers notice when a student goes deep in something meaningful. That kind of self-motivation often begins with support at home.

*Austin Scholar: What is one thing parents shouldn’t do to help their kid?*

Sarah: Parents should not provide additional stress to the student by constantly talking about college applications, as that can quickly become overwhelming. At times, too much pressure from parents can cause students to shut down, burn out, or feel like they’re not good enough. This not only affects their mental health but also makes it harder for them to come off honestly and confidently in their applications, preventing them from conveying their true self. Finding a balance between helping your kid stay organized and on top of deadlines, while also not overwhelming them is important. It’s more helpful to create a calm, supportive space where the student feels trusted, believed in, and in control of their own journey.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

[This article](https://carlhendrick.substack.com/p/ultra-processed-minds-the-end-of) from The Learning Dispatch went super viral on Substack, and its topic is my absolute favorite thing: reading. So, naturally, I felt like I had to do a deep dive on this article for y’all.

The article tackles one central question: What happens to our minds, our habits, and even our character when we trade immersive reading for algorithmic skimming? This asks us to reconsider not just what we read, but how we read – and why it matters.

The article starts with a personal story from Hendrick: wrestling with Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury in college, floundering through its “dense, impenetrable” pages before finding meaning in the very act of confusion. This wasn’t just about understanding a tough book. It was an apprenticeship in cognitive patience – the ability to “linger in difficulty,” to “stay with a complex sentence, a knotty idea, a layered argument long enough for meaning to emerge.”

*“I became attuned to the book's tone, internal rhythm and emotional undertow. Gradually, the fog began to lift. Patterns emerged, connections formed, and I realised that the disorientation I felt was the whole point: Faulkner was immersing me in a mind for whom disorientation was their reality.”*

In contrast, today’s reading habits are being reshaped by platforms that reward speed, novelty, and skimmability. The result? What the author calls “ultra-processed reading”: content engineered for easy consumption, stripped of ambiguity and depth, “syntactically smooth, cognitively shallow, emotionally inert.”

This shift is measurable and profound. Reading for pleasure is in sharp decline, especially among young adults. But the cost isn’t just literary – it’s cognitive, emotional, and civic. Deep reading wires the brain for memory, inference, empathy, and sustained attention. When we lose it, we lose more than stories – we lose the tools for thinking itself.

*“What I fear they'll miss is not literature's beauty but its resistance. The way it trains the mind to slow down, to reflect, to tolerate ambiguity. To reside in the discomfort of the interstitial and be ok with it.”*

The essay introduces a powerful framework: the difference between vertical reading (slow, immersive, recursive) and horizontal reading (skimming, grazing, scrolling). The former shapes the self; the latter disperses it. As “the immersive arc of narrative is giving way to the skimmable feed,” we risk losing our appetite—and even our capacity—for complexity and reflection.

*“The deep, devotional practice of ‘vertical’ reading has been supplanted by ‘horizontal’ reading, skimming along the surface.”*

Layered on top of these trends is the rise of AI-generated content: “articulate without awareness, derivative without depth.” In a world of “copies of copies,” the reader becomes a passive consumer, not a co-creator of meaning.

But Hendrick offers a final thought: in a distracted world, to read deeply is to resist. It’s an act of reclaiming attention, interiority, and the right to complexity.

*“To read slowly, attentively, without agenda or distraction is to resist. Not with noise or spectacle, but with the quiet, deliberate force of contemplation.”*

If we want the next generation to build not just knowledge, but wisdom and resilience, we must defend the slow, uncertain, sometimes uncomfortable practice of real reading. In the age of infinite feeds, the real revolution is to pause – to dwell, to think, to let meaning emerge.

Deep reading is not a nostalgic luxury. It’s a learnable discipline and a form of leverage – one that shapes not just academic results, but the very architecture of thought. In a world optimized for distraction, cognitive patience is your competitive edge. Teach your kid deep reading, and they’ll have an ability to understand and navigate the world like no one else.
