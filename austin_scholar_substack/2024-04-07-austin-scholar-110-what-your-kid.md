### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I learned to be controversial
2. What your kid can learn from *The Bachelor*
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

I had the absolute most incredible birthday weekend last week, and I’m so grateful to all of my friends, my parents, and my sister for being a part of it. We went to Dallas, where we saw a [Waterparks](https://waterparksband.com/) concert, ice skated at the Galleria Dallas in Christmas costumes, and watched a Rangers baseball game – my perfect weekend.

And of course, the weekend was made so much better by all of you. I deeply appreciate all of your messages. I wouldn’t be the person I am without you all. Thank you.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I learned to be controversial

I write some pretty controversial stuff.

From saying kids don’t need teachers to exposing the current state of our education system, a lot of people aren’t too happy with the things I write.

I have people in my comments really going after each other based on whether they agree or disagree with some of my statements.

(Most recently, under my post about interviewing JD Martinez, there is some intense debate on whether he is a good baseball player or not. Very controversial :) )

In all seriousness, it can be hard for me to post something that I know a lot of people will disagree with. I’m naturally a peaceful person and tend to stay away from starting arguments (in a non-regulated situation – I’m always down for a good debate with my friends).

But in case you haven’t noticed, my whole schtick is pretty much being controversial and polarizing about education. So how have I learned to push myself and share my truest, non-watered-down thoughts and experiences?

Confidence.

When I first started writing, I still wasn’t in the best mental headspace, I’d hedge all my statements and tone down my posts.

But as I continued to heal and receive positive feedback from y’all, my confidence started to grow. Every time I got an email from someone saying that something I wrote helped them, I felt more and more sure of myself and what I was doing.

Because of that, my posts got more confident, too.

And not only that, but I had so many people around me inspiring my courage – from my best friend’s insanely controversial takes on food and cancer to my own sister’s dominance on TikTok, I felt like I was supported in my endeavors.

Now, yes, there are people arguing in my comment section about whether or not I’m an idiot, but I have enough self-confidence in my ideas and writing to continue to post.

I’ve learned how to be polarizing – and that it’s not a bad thing to be.

### What your kid can learn from *The Bachelor*

A great way to learn how to be controversial and polarizing is to study this last season of The Bachelor.

Before you roll your eyes, hear me out.

Kids love The Bachelor, so this is an easy example to relate to.

But more importantly, there are a *lot* of crazy social dynamics in *The Bachelor* – both during the season and with the viewers – that can make some great lessons for your kid, starting with the idea that being polarizing isn’t always a bad thing.

1. Being polarizing isn’t bad

The Bachelor context: [Maria](https://bachelor-nation.fandom.com/wiki/Maria_Georgas) is perhaps the most beloved woman to come out of this season of The Bachelor. But honestly, she isn’t really the typical woman you might find on the show. She’s fiery, a little aggressive, and not at all afraid to speak her mind. She doesn’t let any of the other women drag her down – and because of that, she gets caught in almost every argument in the season. She’s different, controversial, and everyone loves her for it.

What this means: Being different, controversial, or polarizing can actually lead to a more committed fan base.

What you can do: Obviously, I’m not suggesting that your kid starts arguments and drama just for the sake of it. But it’s helpful to show them that it’s okay to be truly honest in their thoughts. They don’t have to stay quiet just because people might disagree with them.

In order to help your kid do this, you can…

* Notice and comment on when they hedge their ideas (I might know, this could work, I kind of believe, etc.)
* Not completely shut down something they say that you disagree with – instead, state your opinion and talk it out
* Practice [arguing both sides](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-108-teach-your-kid) so your kid is better able to think critically and have their own thoughts

Not only can you learn about being polarizing from *The Bachelor*, but there are a few more lessons your kid can learn:

2. Don’t put other people down to make yourself feel better

The Bachelor context: One of the arguments Maria is dragged into is with this woman named Sydney. It gets so intense and distracting that Joey brings the two of them on a “2-on-1 date” to pick one of them to stay and one to go home. During the date, Sydney spends the entire time talking about how terrible Maria is and how she can’t live in the same house as Maria. Maria, on the other hand, basically just talks about her relationship with Joey – not mentioning Sydney. In the end, Joey picks Maria to stay and Sydney to leave.

What this means: Putting other people down to make yourself feel better doesn’t pay off.

What you can do: I’ll be honest: most kids hate to say that they were in the wrong – and instead prefer to blame the popular girl, the teacher, that one annoying kid, or anyone else. Even small throwaway comments that serve to make themselves seem better in a story or that “don’t mean anything” increase that bad habit. The best thing you can do is to call out when they’re putting someone down and ask them:

* Why they feel that way about that person
* Why they included that in their story

Give them awareness that what they’re doing is not helping them – and will never help them.

3. Being honest with yourself is critical

The Bachelor context: Daisy is in the final two – but she knows she’s not going to get chosen. So, instead of letting Joey stand next to her and break her heart, she takes control of the narrative. She walks up to him and lets him know that she understands she isn’t going to be chosen – and leaves on her own. She stays in control of the situation because she was completely honest with herself and her relationship.

What this means: Being honest with yourself means you still have control over the situation.

What you can do: Encourage your kid to do self-reflections and discuss what they can improve for next time. Model what it looks like to be honest with yourself for them. Ask them how prepared they feel for a test and then compare that to the actual score – and discuss ways to get more prepared for the next one. Have them talk through the drama that’s going on at their school and ask them for a true depiction of their place in it so they can react accordingly. Essentially, you have to show them that being honest with yourself can only help you.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [Dune](https://www.amazon.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert/dp/0441172717)

I recently watched the Dune movies and immediately went to purchase the book. The Dune world is so fascinating and fosters great conversation with my dad about science fiction and what it means to be a hero. I actually found the writing style to be super clear and manageable (and is a great novel to purchase for any Timothee Chalamet-obsessed teenagers). I loved the first Dune book and rate it a 5/5 stars. (Dad: sorry for not listening to you when you told me it was an awesome book two years ago.)

2. [3 Body Problem](https://www.netflix.com/title/81024821)

My family just finished watching 3 Body Problem on Netflix – and my goodness, it’s pretty crazy. The show facilitates great discussions about extraterrestrial life, the consequences of your actions, faith, science, and so much more. I may or may not have cried a few times – and found myself emotionally invested in a bunch of the characters (some out of love, some out of hate). Definitely recommend watching 3 Body Problem. (It is pretty gory, though, so don’t watch if that’s not your thing.)

3. [Texas Rangers v. Cubs recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBXCqLZjRz0)

Last weekend, the Rangers gave me a birthday gift!! My birthday game ended up being 11-2 Rangers – 13 runs in 2.5 hours (baseball really has gotten a lot shorter). It was genuinely the most fun and I loved seeing all of my favorite players score (and scouting out the new ones!!). The game was just light and fun – a perfect way to spend my birthday.
