### **Hey, y'all!**

Welcome to day two of my launch week! To all of my new subscribers, I'm so excited and grateful that y'all are here! To all of my returning subscribers, welcome back, and thank you for the continued support.

Today from Austin Scholar...

1. The story of using my first online app
2. Austin’s App Analysis: an article that gives an overview on a few of my favorite adaptive apps
3. Three sources centered around adaptive apps

### **Austin's Anecdote**

I used my first online adaptive app when I was in the first grade. Though I was still attending a "normal" school, my dad wanted me to maximize my potential and work on math at home, using an app called [Dreambox](https://www.dreambox.com/).

One of the tools Dreambox uses to teach simple math functions is a game that stars Evil Trolls. I had to quickly answer math problems in order to escape the Evil Trolls. When I started the game, I didn’t know how to subtract, so the Evil Trolls captured me quite often. Unfortunately for my parents, though, I cried every time the Evil Trolls captured me. I was miserable, never able to escape the clutches of the Evil Trolls. To save myself (and my parents’ eardrums), I spent hours figuring out how to subtract seven from fifteen as well as mastering my multiplication tables. The final time I battled the Evil Trolls, I could confidently answer three times three.

Dreambox is adaptive software used to teach students K-8 math, which allowed me to work on third-grade-level math, even though I was only in the first grade. I was able to achieve this because apps allow students to learn at their own pace. Each student is given the same content in the apps but can work through it as quickly as they choose. The adaptability comes into play as the app recognizes which questions the student is getting correct and will move them to more complicated problems. If the student doesn’t seem to understand a concept, which is shown by getting the questions incorrect, the app will provide them with the basics they need to understand the concept.

Since Dreambox, I began to exclusively use online apps to learn, and **nine years later I have consistently scored in the 99th percentile of my grade level**. To reach this level of mastery, I have experimented with *many* different online adaptive apps, and have plenty of opinions on what the best apps are to learn anything: from math, to history, to foreign languages.  I will be writing about specific apps in future articles.

Today's article does a deeper dive into adaptive learning apps and how to choose the right one.

### **Austin’s App Analysis**

### **How to Choose the Best Online App**

The most important criteria in judging educational apps are adaptability and content.

Adaptability in apps is judged by how well the app adjusts the content based on what each student knows. One of the best examples of adaptivity in apps is [Aleks](https://www.aleks.com/), which specializes in teaching K-12 math. When each student starts the course, they are given a pre-test, which allows the student to test out of the topics that they already know. As the student works through the course, they receive Knowledge Checks. Knowledge Checks allow the student to prove their mastery over the content they learned. If a student fails to show mastery over certain topics, they are given the chance to re-do the lessons that they struggled with.

Content is measured in three dimensions: quality, breadth, and depth. The quality aspect ensures that the explanations are helpful and useful for any type of learner (ex. videos vs. written explanations). Breadth is all about making sure that the app covers all of the concepts for each course or grade level. Finally, depth refers to the question bank, or the number of different questions for each concept. A deep question bank is important because it makes it hard for the student to “hack” the app and simply memorize the answers for a few questions. For having comprehensive content, there is no better example than [Knewton](https://www.knewton.com/), which is an app that covers all of the subject matter in each grade level. With over 100 lessons per class, Knewton doesn't have any learning holes.

Unfortunately, though, there is no such thing as a perfect app. The app will either have poor explanations, not enough content or adaptability, or easy ways to “hack” the app. A fool-proof way to make sure that your child is learning and mastering the content is to sequence apps, or to complete multiple apps for each course. This allows for both criteria, adaptability and content, to be met.

When sequencing apps, it is best to start with the most comprehensive app, such as [Knewton](https://www.knewton.com/). With the first app, adaptability is not as much of a concern, as the student is seeing all-new content. The second app is best for filling in any learning holes and guaranteeing mastery. I would recommend an app such as [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). Khan Academy is more adaptable than Knewton, as it has Mastery Challenges at the end of each chapter, but Khan Academy's strength is explaining overall topics and themes, rather than individual equations. The final app should be used to prove mastery and should be the most adaptable, so an app like [Aleks](https://www.aleks.com/) is perfect. The third app should take the least amount of time, as this will be the third time the student is seeing the content. Following this app-sequencing formula will provide your child with mastery of any course and will ensure that all of the bases are covered.

## **What are the best apps?**

The #1 question I get from parents: What are the best apps for my child?

I will be diving deep into individual apps in future articles, but here are some quick summary thoughts.  Every child is different, so feel free to post questions and I will do my best to answer.

I’ve used dozens of apps and put in thousands of hours over the years, so I have LOTS of opinions.

#### **MATH**

[Knewton](https://www.knewton.com/) (Math: High School)

Knewton is extremely comprehensive and crushes the content aspect. Each individual lesson in Knewton is adaptive, as you have to answer at least four questions in a row correctly to move on, but the overall course is not because there is no way to test out of the content.

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) (Math: K-12)

Khan Academy is definitely a crowd favorite and is a perfect medium. Khan is more adaptive than Knewton, but not as adaptive as Aleks. Khan Academy is perfect for understanding overall concepts but doesn't test individual questions and topics as well.

[Aleks](https://www.aleks.com/) (Math: K-12)

Aleks is the most adaptive out of these three, with constant Knowledge Checks and opportunities to test out of content. Aleks is perfect for confirming mastery.

#### **SCIENCE**

[Cengage](https://www.cengage.com/) (Science: AP Courses)

Cengage is an app that teaches AP courses. There are tests for each topic and chapter, a "notes" and "flashcards" feature, and plenty of study guides. Though it's not very adaptive, Cengage is perfect for the first run-through.

[Knewton](https://www.knewton.com/) (Science: High School)

(See the above explanation in Math)

#### **READING/LANGUAGE**

[CommonLit](https://www.commonlit.org/) & [NewsELA](https://newsela.com/) (Reading Comprehension: K-12)

Both of these apps provide students with articles to read, then test the students on the article. CommonLit and NewsELA help teach the overall understanding of how to break down a piece of writing. The apps allow students to choose the Lexile Level, so these apps have some adaptability.

[eGumpp](https://egumpp.com/) (Grammar: High School)

eGumpp teaches grammar and sentence structure and is also incredibly comprehensive.

[IXL](https://www.ixl.com/?partner=google&campaign=71588368&adGroup=131124160531&gclid=CjwKCAjwy7CKBhBMEiwA0Eb7ajfIZoGB3BR_f3_hlPRoQApBloI-TmLSxvLaKhH67I4bX-9nGrXFWRoCbt4QAvD_BwE) (Language: K-12)

IXL Language has a very in-depth curriculum. It teaches students all they need to know about Reading & Writing Strategies, Vocabulary, and Grammar & Mechanics.

#### **HISTORY**

[Cengage](https://www.cengage.com/) (History: AP Courses)

(See the above explanation in Science)

#### **TESTING**

[Albert](https://www.albert.io/) (Test Prep: K-12)

Albert is helpful because the app specializes in practice tests (SAT, ACT, AP, and more) and helps the students understand what they need to know before taking tests.

#### **FOREIGN LANGUAGE**

[Mango](https://learn.mangolanguages.com/login) (Foreign Languages: High School)

For learning a foreign language, Mango is incredible. The app contains four years of content, has daily review cards to practice repetition, and has voice recording features to compare the students' pronunciation with a native speaker's.

**Using apps doesn't mean your child is not going to struggle.** It's learning. It's going to be hard. But your children don't have to spend all day sitting in a classroom, bored, and not understanding the content. **Apps will allow your children to work through the content at their own pace**, focus on the topics they're struggling with, and breeze past the topics they've mastered. Everyone has Evil Trolls to work through, and you have the chance to give your kids the tools they need to defeat them.

Khan also has a great video on the importance of [mastery](https://www.khanacademy.org/khan-for-educators/k4e-us-demo/xb78db74671c953a7:getting-to-know-khan/xb78db74671c953a7:introduction-to-mastery-learning/v/what-is-mastery-learning) in learning, a concept that I am going to elaborate on in my next post.

[This article on Knewton Alta](https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-digit/submission/knewton-personalizes-learning-with-the-power-of-ai/) is an interesting Harvard write-up on one of my favorites. The article discusses Knewton’s use of AI in learning and a study with over 10,000 students that proves Knewton’s success.

[This Dreambox blog post](https://www.dreambox.com/resources/blogs/six-key-benefits-of-adaptive-learning) describes 6 key benefits of adaptive learning. Though the post is written through the lens of a classroom and more blended learning (using both apps and teachers) experience, the concepts and benefits still apply.
