### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

### Learning a life skill–receiving feedback

Since I made the mistake last week of sending a draft newsletter (it wasn’t up to my own standards) and not the final, I thought I’d take this week’s newsletter to go over the editing process and how I received feedback. One of the biggest weaknesses of teens is that we’re super defensive and don’t love to take any criticism or feedback. (Usually, any negative word from a parent will end in slammed doors and silent treatment.)

This newsletter may be worth showing to your teen as an example of one of their peers taking feedback (and surviving it). Taking feedback is still, of course, hard for me–especially this publicly. But I also know it’s an important part of becoming a better writer, and a better person.

Also, I thought that showing my own mistakes and errors might help other teens swallow feedback more easily–and more importantly, show them that by learning to gracefully take feedback, they can achieve great things.

Like writing a newsletter about a big life event that’s actually worthy of being shared far and wide.

Attached is my original draft with feedback:

As you can see, my first version was a stream-of-consciousness report written as I was coming out of Budapest. It was too “me”-centric. The kids were the important part of the story. Not me.

The biggest issue for a teen writer–and frankly, teenagers in general–is that we’re obsessed with our own angst. With what is going on in *our* lives. But this leads to boring, unrelatable, insignificant writing.

Learning to give attention to other people–and having gratitude–is one of the most life-changing things any teen can do. Writing for other people has not only transformed my writing, but also made me a much happier, loving person.

I will be writing a future newsletter on how to teach your kid to accept feedback gracefully.
