### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I learned to debate about current events
2. Teach your kid to argue both sides
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

I learned pretty much the most insane thing ever this week.

My dad was at a [SXSW](https://www.sxsw.com/) event and told me that some of the people there get together and talk about my newsletter every Sunday – about what advice I’d given and how to apply it. What?!

A lot of the time, I feel like I’m writing into the void, so hearing that actual people are reading my content is incredible.

On that note, if any of y’all ever have any questions about the newsletter, my experiences, or anything else, please feel free to reach out!! I’d love to meet you :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I learned to debate about current events

On the topic of conversations, I recently had a pretty unique experience.

Alpha students were invited down to the new [University of Austin](https://www.uaustin.org/), to complete the Mill Institute’s Viewpoint Diversity Challenge.

Basically, the goal of the challenge was to facilitate open, balanced, respectful discussion about the Israeli-Hamas conflict.

Now, I’m someone who prefers to stay away from political discussions. I dislike how chaotic and hurtful they can get, so I was pretty nervous about doing this.

The night before, we were assigned a podcast to listen to detailing both sides of the conflict and wrote down notes.

Here’s what mine looked like:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AZcu!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d83667c-ce43-46fb-bef2-a032718e1960_2240x2005.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AZcu!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d83667c-ce43-46fb-bef2-a032718e1960_2240x2005.jpeg)

There were a few rules for the discussion, but the most interesting was that we must assume that the speaker has good intentions – not hurtful ones.

So often, people assume the worst interpretation in an effort to take a speaker down. Instead, we should be giving them grace and realizing they have reasons for what they believe – and that they’re not trying to be hurtful.

At the event, this established a baseline of respect and kindness in the room.

And so when people had conflicting opinions about the situation, they knew to assume the best from the other person. Arguments assuming the worst were dismissed.

Because of this, we were actually able to have a fascinating discussion about the Israeli-Hamas conflict – without insults and petty fighting. I learned a lot from both sides and everyone was able to have a balanced discussion. There was no reason for me to have been worried.

And as my friend [Peyton Price](https://peytonprice.substack.com/) said, “In Gen Z discourse on this conflict today, there is absolutely no room to ask questions and seek understanding of differing viewpoints… Instead, there are unprecedented levels of hatred, cancel-culture, and polarization. If we can't teach and allow young people to have civil, open discussions about contentious topics, our society is not truly free and won't survive.”

The Mill Institute ended up [writing an article](https://www.uaustin.org/blog/the-mill-institute-promotes-dialogue-on-middle-east-conflict) about our experience there – so y’all should definitely check that out!

### Teach your kid to argue both sides

Having a balanced mindset and being able to think critically about differing arguments is not something that’s easy to learn – especially for young kids.

So how can you teach them to do this? Argue both sides.

Forcing kids to argue both sides can show them that there really are two sides to every story – and that the world isn’t as black-and-white as they might think.

Obviously, most kids aren’t ready to discuss something as contentious as the Israel-Hamas conflict.

I’d recommend starting with something they care about, like household rules.

Whenever your kid has a rule they’d like to change (no sleepovers on school nights, how far they’re able to drive on their own, allowance, bedtime… anything really), make them argue both sides.

Stop them before it gets too heated and tell them to create two presentations: one arguing why the rule should be changed and one arguing why it should stay the same. If they still want to change the rule, have them address the other side and make a counterargument.

If they understand both sides well, they'll be able to help come up with compromises to keep both sides happy.

For example, a concern about having sleepovers on school nights could be that the kids don’t get their homework done. If your kid is able to recognize that, they’ll be able to create their own conditions for the sleepover – such as, their friend can’t come over until both of their homework is done.

Once they do this exercise, your kid will have a better understanding of why the rule exists – and because they understand the why, and negotiate around it, they can take on more responsibility in their life.

And once they’re masters at arguing both sides, you can move onto more challenging topics: from the perspective of the villain in their favorite TV show, to cellphone and social media use, and finally, to current events.

Make sure *you* approach every conversation with an open mind and ensure your kid feels supported. Always encourage critical thinking and noticing the nuance in reality. Show your kid the value of being able to argue both sides.

If you do that, they’ll be well on their way to being able to have those open discussions about hard things that are so important.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [How to become an expert in ANYTHING FAST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6vEU6FPOAc)

Part of being an Alpha student is knowing *how to learn*. Because of that, I’m always looking for content and advice out there for learning how to learn, especially with AP season and finals coming up. I loved this video and feel like it could be really useful for those kids of yours who procrastinated learning Physics 2 until two months before the exam (couldn’t be me…). Anyway, this video has lots of learning science built-in and super actionable tips.

2. [becoming smart is easy, actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5OJJD3Eytk)

The overall message of this video is how to seem competent and become well-spoken – basically just how to come across well in conversations. This is a topic I am personally really interested in and something I would love to write a future newsletter on. Let me know if that’s something y’all would like!!

(Also – this YouTube channel “easy, actually” has three other videos explaining concepts in a similar way, all of which are awesome.)

3. [Once Upon a Broken Heart](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/55987278)

One of my favorite ways to bond with my friends is to read the books they love. So when *two* of my friends told me they loved *Once Upon a Broken Heart*, I obviously had to check it out. It’s a super cute fantasy-magic story – and is a part of the *Caraval* universe (I’ve recommended it here before!!). Loved the book. Solid ⅘ stars.

(Now I have a lot to talk to my friends about. Maybe y’all could do something similar to [connect with your kids](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-70-how-to-intentionally)…)
