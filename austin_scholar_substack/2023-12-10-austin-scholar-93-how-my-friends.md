### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How my friends and I built an online course in 48 hours
2. A framework for running your own teen Hackathon
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been reading…

So… I had my Oxford interviews this week. Unfortunately, I didn’t do as well as I had hoped to, so I had a few sad days. I think I said the Serenity Prayer twenty times in a row, though, so I’m feeling much better now :)

On another note, I landed my first Lutz jump (an ice skating move) this week and am working up to my axel!! Having a sport as a hobby, not a stressor, is one of the best decisions I’ve made. I get to enjoy working out my nervous energy in a way where I can actually see progress. Highly recommend doing this yourself – finding ways to have fun while being active.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How my friends and I built an online course in 48 hours

High schoolers can do anything.

My classmates and I just spent 48 hours this weekend:

* Creating a [4-week online course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRT5i9eAwQmh7m7XrxjNtW3pWFSCEtc1CRXVcgwtRgI/edit?usp=sharing) on how to have a 75% chance at getting into an Ivy League (with speaker scripts, exercises, breakout rooms, etc.)
* Making a [30-page Second Brain](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLfGLRfr1yBgtXnqXhiDD_qllVcJ5MrajvcJCOW1Utk/edit?usp=sharing) with all of the best information from experts in the field
* Making 100+ marketing videos for TikTok and Instagram and [writing a PR plan](https://harmless-dog-242.notion.site/PR-for-75-percent-chance-9ecff2d246f34e0b91490142f41e1d35)

  + Already have 250,000 views on Instagram (@75percentchance)
  + Already have 500,000 views on TikTok (@75percentchance)
* Creating a [Twitter account following the top 100 experts in this space](https://twitter.com/75percentchance)
* Creating a [landing page](https://75percentchance.com) and email capture system

  + Already have 100 people on the waitlist
* Writing a book (yes, a full book) to go along with the course
* Creating a [GPT to calculate admissions chances](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-V7BiwqmZ1-75-chance-of-getting-into-an-ivy-league-gpt)
* Creating a [ChatBot](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-V7BiwqmZ1-75-chance-of-getting-into-an-ivy-league-gpt) powered by the Second Brain
* Writing a [2-minute pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SqAtf_IQI78QSzc-K1X_NRdsS4cUZjz-E8NTgUsAHik/edit?usp=sharing) for the course (posted on the website)
* Writing a [Succession Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18LH5BFC9q1sJobBSoaGxBd4aBvsQUrhcEysu18dBdUk/edit?usp=sharing) for our next CEO

How? Well, we used the [Y-School framework](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-92-y-school).

At the beginning of the weekend, our group of eight students got together to choose a project to spend 48 hours on. Having discussed it a little bit already with our Alpha guides, we decided to create the 75% chance workshop.

We’d identified that college counselors are pretty much lying to students about what top admissions officers are looking for and hurting their chances at getting into an Ivy League. We wanted to rectify this.

We spent hours that first day researching everything about college admissions – finding Harvard statistics and reading books by ex-college admissions officers. We then compiled all of our information into a Second Brain and started discussing what would go into a workshop.

Once the basic ideas of the workshop were developed, we split up.

My sister and her best friend took to TikTok, working to gain traction for the idea. They probably spent over twelve hours writing and filming TikTok videos, constantly experimenting and working to go viral.

Another one of my friends – who didn’t have any coding experience, just an eye for design – began working on the landing page. He had to learn basic copywriting and how to create an email capture system. He crushed it, though.

A pair of sisters worked together to create a college admissions chance simulator and ChatBot using the Second Brain – eventually using AI to write an actual book titled “75% Chance.” Insane.

In between all of this work, we went out to a nice dinner and spent a few hours swimming around in a lazy river to refresh our brains.

As a whole, we were all so supportive of one another and fully committed to achieving our goals. That made it easy for each of us to feed off of their energy and continue to crush it, which then continued the cycle.

We did some insane things in 48 hours – most of which we’d never done before.

And that’s the power of the Y-School framework.

### A framework for running your own teen Hackathon

First off, if this is something you’re interested in your child being able to do, connect with [Alpha High](https://alphahigh.school/).

But you can, of course, try this on your own.

Here’s how you can do this type of Hackathon in a weekend:

First of all, everything is more enjoyable with friends, so pull together a group of peers that your kid can build this project with. Make sure that the group is one where every kid is motivated – and won’t be a distraction.

Then, have the kids come up with a big, slightly insane project (what the Y-School framework calls an Olympic-level Project).

It can be really hard to think of an Olympic-level Project, so a good place to start is to take what your kid is passionate about (check out [this newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-31-how-to-constructively) for more details on finding your passion), find a [unique perspective](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-3-the-sheep-god-of) on that passion, and build an online course.

Building a course is great practice for lots of skills: building expertise, marketing, finding customers, public speaking, and so much more. Creating a course is a great place to start – and if you get it published on an online platform or run it for other students, it looks great on a resumé.

Next comes Becoming an Expert. In this stage, your group of kids will need to create a [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) filled with all of the greatest insights, ideas, experts, books, and articles in their field. This will help them gain insights and identify problems that they can solve.

Now it’s time to start divvying up tasks:

* Create a [memo](https://twitter.com/chiefaioffice/status/1709312211993104757?s=58&t=8_mwT6_AF5tOVsj-WQV_zw) to describe the course

  + Use ChatGPT to turn the memo into a 2-minute pitch following [Elon Musk’s pitching structure](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-88-my-5-top-rules)
  + Use a [marketing GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-Ji2QOyMml-copywriter-gpt?ref=therundown) to generate blog posts, tweets, and short-form video content from the memo and the second brain

* Create the course content

  + Start with four sessions – with an introduction, two exercises, a breakout room, and a lecture
* Start posting

  + Create social media accounts
  + Post 10 times on each platform based on the marketing content
* Build a landing page

  + Use a [landing page builder](https://zapier.com/blog/best-landing-page-builders/) to easily create a website

These are some fantastic goals to start with, and though it may seem overwhelming at first, continue breaking down the tasks until they seem manageable, and then just start working. Your kid (and you!!) will be surprised at how efficient and straightforward AI makes a lot of these tasks.

You can make this Hackathon an huge, dramatic event and get kids excited about unlocking their potential. This is a great opportunity for your kid to grow and prove how much, exactly, they’re capable of.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been reading…

1. [The Elon Musk biography](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1982181281)

I haven’t finished the biography yet, but I’m working my way through Musk’s absolutely fascinating journey. There are some great lessons on resilience, leadership, and innovation in the biography – so if you believe it could be appropriate for your kid, I highly recommend going through it together.

2. [East of Eden](https://www.amazon.com/East-of-Eden-John-Steinbeck-audiobook/dp/B0055WXTPQ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=East+of+Eden&qid=1701913209&s=books&sr=1-1)

East of Eden is the first Steinbeck novel I’ve read (I know, for a self-proclaimed lover of literature, that might seem crazy), but I’m hooked. It’s definitely a long and dense read, but Steinbeck beautifully echoes the stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel in the novel. It’s a fantastic piece on morality and questions what being a good person truly is – and can someone be born good or born evil. Very thought provoking and a fantastic conversation starter (or dinner discussion book).

3. [Cancer: A Foodborne Illness by Grace Price](https://x.com/travelingenes/status/1730074553395622320?s=20)

I am so unbelievably proud of one of my best friends for literally filming an entire documentary on her findings on the prevention of cancer. She’s a student at Alpha High as well, so it’s been amazing to see her grow and work to create this absolutely incredible documentary. I can’t wait to see the entire thing :) Go support her!!
