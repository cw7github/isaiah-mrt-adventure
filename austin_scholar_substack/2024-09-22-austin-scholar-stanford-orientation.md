### **Hey, y'all!**

I’m truly so sorry about this, but unfortunately I do not have a newsletter for you this week. Orientation at Stanford has been going strong all week and I did not have time to write. I do promise that this next year’s newsletters will be awesome – you’ll learn how to help your kid get into a top 20 school from my thousands of classmates at Stanford. I’ve already had great conversations and can’t wait to share them with you.

For all of my new subscribers, I’m deeply apologetic that this is your first newsletter from me, but here are some of my older newsletters that I’d recommend you read for a look into what a typical week would look like:
