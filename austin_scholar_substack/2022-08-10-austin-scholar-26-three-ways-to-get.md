### **Hey, y'all!**

I have returned to Austin from two of the greatest weeks of my entire life. I had such a transformative experience at Oxford, and I feel like I’m coming back changed.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: Recap of my two weeks at Oxford University
2. Three ways to get your kid ready for the school year
3. Scholar’s Sources: My top resources for preparing for college in high school

Since I’ve been out of the loop the past couple of weeks, here are a few life updates to get you caught up:

School begins on August 17th, so I’ve been buying binders and prepping my calendars.

I’ve been continuing to work on Write of Passage: Liftoff, writing newsletters, and spending hours on Twitter. (Go follow [@AustinScholar](https://twitter.com/AustinScholar)!) On that note– I got my first hate comment on Twitter, and I honestly feel like that’s an achievement.

And… I got my driving permit! The DPS finally accepted that I, indeed, had all one hundred of the correct documents.

So, yeah. It’s been pretty busy since I’ve gotten back, and it’s only going to get busier, so stay tuned for some awesome updates.

(Side note – this is the 26th newsletter, which means I’ve been writing these for half of an entire year! Time sure flies.)

One last thing: I’ve been talking to some readers and have received the recommendation to change my publishing day to Saturday or Sunday instead of in the middle of the week. Would you prefer to get this newsletter in your inbox on the weekend? Or do you prefer it on a weekday? Hit reply and let me know your thoughts!

### Austin’s Anecdote: Recap Of My Two Weeks At Oxford University

This week’s anecdote isn’t related to the article, but I had such an amazing time at Oxford that I want to tell you all about it.

First off, the physical location of Oxford is stunning and historical, and that’s something that was really important to me.

I live in Austin, Texas, where there are glass highrises in the city and dead grass during the summer. Also, comparatively, the United States in general is pretty young in terms of world history. That’s what I’m used to.

So, when I arrived at Oxford, I was completely awed by the intricacy of the stone architecture. There were bushes of flowers at every corner and actually healthy-looking grass. I seriously felt like I was in a movie.

And the years of history every building exuded just made me swoon:

The Bodleian Library, with its horror stories of books being burned.

St. Mary’s Church, where generations of students graduated from Oxford.

The Ashmolean, where the first recorded instance of writing and communication is on display.

All these beautiful and monumental structures made me feel connected to the world and its people in a way I never had.

I wanted to learn every single secret the hundred-year-old walls held and read the words of hundreds of ancient scholars.

Simply being at Oxford changed me.

And that’s not even getting into the incredible people I was surrounded by, which was the best and most valuable part of that experience. I won’t gush, because I could wax poetic for hours about everything I learned from the eight lovely souls I spent two weeks writing with, but here’s something that every single one of us said at our final dinner together:

“There was a moment where I felt like I might be the worst writer in this group, and that was one of the best things to happen to me because it made me want to work harder and be a better writer.”

Wow. Is that not one of the most beautiful things?

I was in a place where I was with such extraordinary people who constantly inspired each other to want to be better.

I nearly cried when, at the closing ceremony, our professor read out our final project: a collaborative piece on goodbyes. Each brilliant, unique voice shone through and I realized exactly the type of people I want to spend the rest of my life surrounded by.

I also got a chance to see what independent life would look like for me. I made sure I had food for meals, purchased a fan in time for the hottest day in Oxford’s history, made it to all of the right places at the right times, made sure I slept enough hours, and set enough alarms and reminders to keep myself organized.

I feel like I matured a little bit–in figuring out all of these aspects of life. I felt like a wide-eyed kid getting a list of responsibilities for the first time and rushing to prove that I can do it.

And then I became a jaded teenager who hates the entire world when I got stopped three separate times by security in the London airport. After the third baggage check, you would think that the system would realize that my liquids were, in fact, contained in the appropriately-sized bag and that my portable charger wasn’t dangerous.

Jokes and horrible airport experiences aside, this trip to Oxford was exactly what I needed. I didn’t exactly have a relaxing summer (my newsletter, Write of Passage, other school stuff, driving, etc.) and I was starting to feel a little bit drained.

This trip reenergized me through incredible history and amazing peers and a taste of independence. Oxford reminded me of what my goals are and what I’m working towards.

### Three Ways To Get Your Kid Ready For The School Year

School for most kids is right around the corner. Here are my top recommendations to help your kid get prepped!

#### Encourage Your Kid To Take Ownership Over Their Education

I know I’ve already written an entire newsletter on this idea (see [Austin Scholar #6: Teenagers Need To Take Control Of Their Education](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-6-teenagers-need-to)), but since it’s the beginning of a new school year, it’s a great time to revisit talking to your kids about owning their education.

“Owning your education” is a pretty ambiguous phrase. It can be hard to start a conversation around it.

But, this short questionnaire that I took during the [gt.school](https://gt.school/) bootcamp is a brilliant place to begin:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zEZ6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf0581ec-f447-457d-a65f-38cac12546f7_1262x986.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zEZ6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf0581ec-f447-457d-a65f-38cac12546f7_1262x986.png)

These questions might be great to walk through with your teen to spark conversation – and they become a great segue into the next section: goals.

#### Set Ambitious Goals… Together

Throughout their academic career, many parents want their kid to get perfect grades and get into a good college and do everything they wish they’d done.

That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it also might not be what their kid wants.

Forcing goals onto kids is just setting them up for failure. If their heart isn’t in it, they won’t work as hard or as well.

Letting kids spend time working towards their *own* goals gives them the opportunity to spend their time achieving something amazing that they want to do. And if they want to do it, they’ll do a much better job.

For parents, the beginning of the school year is the perfect time to figure out what it is that your kid wants to learn, achieve, and focus on this year.

So, have a conversation ([two people are involved!](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-22-how-to-help-your)) with your kid about their goals. Whether they want to start a YouTube channel, become valedictorian, volunteer at the food bank, win the state championship basketball game, write a book, get 100K followers on Twitter, start an Etsy shop, write a chemistry research paper, or whatever else your kid is passionate about, encourage them to work towards it.

Set ambitious goals based on their life goals. Spend time researching opportunities or experiences to help your kid reach their goals. Competitions, internships, and online courses are a great place to start (I have some more ideas in [Austin Scholar #22: How To Help Your Kid Find Value In Their Summer](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-22-how-to-help-your)).

Your kid doesn’t have to have everything figured out yet, but a few clear goals are a good place to start.

#### Create A Time Management System

Everyone would agree that having a time management system in place during school is a useful tool. But, usually, they’re done incorrectly.

The best way to teach your kid where to spend their time is according to their values. What does that mean, you might ask?

Well, in [Austin Scholar #9: The Accounting Disaster of Sixth Grade](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-9-the-accounting-disaster), I talk about the Values Pie Chart Exercise (I’m still workshopping the name).

In the Values Pie Chart Exercise, your kid writes down a few aspects of their life that are important to them (for example, mine are working on my passions, spending time with my friends and family, staying active, and being successful in school).

The list doesn’t have to be fancy or unique. It just has to represent the things your kid genuinely values.

The next step is to draw a circle, and then fill up the circle with pie slices of the things that they value. The bigger the pie slice, the more valuable, important, or significant.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HnmO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2df808fb-57eb-418e-81af-6e3a6c4930cb_1094x376.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HnmO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2df808fb-57eb-418e-81af-6e3a6c4930cb_1094x376.png)

The pie chart is simply a reflection of what matters to your kid and shows how it would make sense to divide up their time during the school year.

From the pie chart, you and your kid can create a system or schedule where they are spending their time in a way that is proportional to their pie chart.

By teaching your kid to spend time on the things that matter to them, they will live a “rich, meaningful, values-driven life,” which will fill them up with satisfaction they couldn’t get if they spent their time doing what other people tell them to do.

### Scholar’s Sources: My Top Resources For Preparing For College In High School

Obviously, I’m not a certified expert in college admissions, or what high schoolers should do in order to get into college. While that is true, I am currently in the process of trying to do the right things, take the right courses, and prep the right way in order to have the best chance of getting into the college I want.

My knowledge comes from what my college counselor has told me, what my parents have said, and what tips Professor Basker (the man who founded the Oxford program I went to) gave during a seminar two weeks ago.

And, of course, the internet.

So, below are four sources that I have used that can hopefully help you and your kid in planning out this school year.

[College Planning Timeline](https://myfuture.com/college/planning/college-planning-timeline?gclid=CjwKCAjw6MKXBhA5EiwANWLODIFSAzThSGKl3HxpbEC4QlWgfY0ZLOLvq22bN9jz7c-W17ugenG2gBoCtUUQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

This website provides a visual timeline of what high school students should do each year to plan for college. The timeline is very clear and provides an overview of the suggested tasks and activities.

[Five Things To Do In High School](https://www.hesc.ny.gov/prepare-for-college/your-high-school-path-to-college/five-things-to-do-in-high-school.html)

This website provides more details and examples of most of the tasks from the [College Planning Timeline](https://myfuture.com/college/planning/college-planning-timeline?gclid=CjwKCAjw6MKXBhA5EiwANWLODIFSAzThSGKl3HxpbEC4QlWgfY0ZLOLvq22bN9jz7c-W17ugenG2gBoCtUUQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) website.

[Online Extracurricular Activities](https://www.pondercollege.com/blog/best-online-extracurricular-activities) & [Extracurriculars You Can Do At Home](https://blog.collegevine.com/extracurriculars-you-can-do-at-home/)

Both of these websites outline extracurricular activities that were recommended during quarantine, but I find that these are pretty good ideas even after we’ve gone back to in-person school. From starting a YouTube channel or a business, to starting a virtual feedback group, to creating marketing materials for a charitable organization, these lists have at least a few activities that your high school student will love.

Watch out for a future newsletter where I go over all of the tips that an actual college admissions officer gave while I was at Oxford :)
