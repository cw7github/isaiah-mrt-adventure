### **Hey, y'all!**

Welcome to the Austin Scholar newsletter! To all of my new subscribers, I'm so excited and grateful that y'all are here! To all of my returning subscribers, welcome back, and thank you for the continued support.

Please forward this newsletter to other parents who want to learn ways to help make twelve years of school less painful and more fulfilling for their children.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. How my parents helped me overcome my mental health struggles
2. Where parent–teenager communication issues come from
3. Things you can do to improve communication with your teen

Mental Health Awareness Month continues! In the [first newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-15-even-if-its-not?s=whttps://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-15-even-if-its-not?s=w) of this series, I began my own story with my mental health and introduced some data from a survey I sent to Alpha High students about why they struggle with talking to their parents about their mental health. Throughout this newsletter, I hope to give y’all some tips for bridging the communication gap between parents and teenagers.

In next week’s newsletter, I am going to be answering FAQs from parents about teenagers and mental health, so **make sure to message me if you have any burning questions.**

In case you missed last week’s disclaimers: I am not a therapist. I am not saying I am a therapist. I am not diagnosing your children. My hope is to draw from my own experiences and the stories of my friends to give y’all a view into the darker parts of a teenager’s mind.

### Austin’s Anecdote

After the silent struggle I wrote about in my last newsletter, my parents finally realized the depth of what was going on in my mind. It was their belief that my refusal to talk to them about my struggles was what was causing my internal suffering.

My parents' solution was to force me to talk to them about my feelings for two hours every single day.

Yeah, that didn't go too well.

Every day, I would wake up dreading the two hours where I would sit on the floor of my parents' bedroom and cry as my parents asked me why I was feeling so horrible. My dad had his iPad out and would take notes as I talked about how depressed and anxious I was; my mom would cry when I mentioned that some of it was because of them.

And I would sit in that room and spiral as I tried to justify and explain my feelings. For two hours. And I couldn't leave.

We did ten days in a row of forced conversation, and we didn't problem solve anything. We didn't come up with new ways to support each other. I just complained and they just felt bad.

It was, excuse my language, a shitshow.

After these ten days, I asked my parents to allow me to take some space and work on myself in a safe environment. Because we were all stressed and frustrated and not improving, they agreed. One month later, after being able to explore different ways to express my anxiety and frustration, I was able to talk to my parents with a clear(er) mind and we were able to actually communicate. Instead of blaming each other, we acknowledged that we could have all done something different.

No longer were the forced two hours of talking. Instead, we started doing family walks down 2nd Street and spending time in the mornings before school talking and watching reality TV.

And if I began to start feeling anxious or unhappy, I would simply text them and explain what was going on, and they would ask how they could support me (more on that later). We learned to work together and communicate without force.

Obviously, a lot of work had to be done in between the 10 Miserable Days and our Great New System, and every family is going to need a different system to motivate conversation, but I hope that my family’s story can give every single parent who reads this hope that communication between themselves and their teenager is possible.

### Where parent–teenager communication issues come from

When thinking about how to fix communication between parents and teenagers, many people seem to think it’s a lost cause.

In the survey that I sent to Alpha High students, though, there seemed to be a pretty clear answer.

When asked “What is something you wish you could tell your parents,” over 70% of the students responded that they wished their parents would “listen to what I’m saying” or “try to understand how I’m feeling.”

Also, when asked about a positive experience with their parents and mental health, those who answered (many said they had not had a positive experience) said that their parents listened to them and helped them solve their problems.

It seems as though listening and empathizing with your teenager could go a long way. Who knew?

Before you say, “Austin, I listen to my teenagers just fine. They just don’t want to talk to me,” think for a moment about *how* you’re listening.

Let me explain.

When we’re really young, we all need lots of directions and information about how to live and go about our daily lives. As we get older, though, we start to rely more on ourselves to make decisions. This all seems obvious, right? Well, as teenagers begin the transition from holding your hand to walking on their own, we begin to expect that our parents will treat us as adults. After all, we’re only a few years away from adulthood.

The problem is, we’re all idiots. We haven’t lived in the world long enough to know what a good decision is, and what the impacts of a bad decision are. And so, parents still treat us like we need to be holding their hand. And when our parents treat us like idiots, we act like idiots, which causes our parents to continue to treat us like idiots, and so on.

While I understand that this comes from a place of love and protection, it leads many teenagers to believe that their parents don’t respect or value what they have to say.

We want to be treated with respect. We want to be treated as though we are more than just stupid kids (even if sometimes we are).

This, along with negative media representation of teenager-parent relationships, causes a lot of teenagers to view parents as though parents and teenagers are not connected emotionally or mentally. It’s as though parents are an entirely different species.

Anyway, by continuing to highlight the differences between the parent and the teen, the teenager starts believing that the parent *won’t understand how they’re feeling*, because of how different the two are.

And then, the lack of communication of the smaller things (I’m struggling in this class / I have a boyfriend / etc.) turns into a habit of not talking to their parents at all. And when there *is* something important or harmful happening (I’m being bullied / I want to hurt myself / etc.), they don’t tell their parents.

All of that being said, learning to listen to teenagers with respect about all aspects of their lives, not just the serious stuff, is the first step in improving communication between parents and teenagers.

Obviously, the scenario I just described does not happen in every family, and so if you are a parent who already listens to your teen with respect, doing the same with your teenager’s friends, and just generally being an adult that teenagers can trust can be instrumental in helping another teen in their struggle with mental health.

### Things you can do to improve communication with your teen

Here is a list of a few things that you can do right now to improve the communication and connection between you and your teenager.

* Talk to your kid about the things they are interested in.

  + Take time out of your day to talk to your kid about whatever they’re obsessed with at the moment. Honestly, talking with my dad about the Red Sox and Marvel movies is what allowed our bond to heal so well.
  + Showing interest in what your kid likes can also help to build trust between the two of you, which increases communication.

    - Please don’t belittle, tease, or make fun of their interests or coping mechanisms. Even just one comment can create a narrative to a teenager that their parents won’t listen to them.
* Talk to your kid about *yourself*, not just them.

  + Vulnerability encourages vulnerability! This is seriously one of the best ways to start increasing communication. Talking to your kid about your day or telling them about a book series you loved as a kid can bring you back down to their level, and encourage them to talk to you about the same things.
* If your kid struggles with talking to you, ask them to text or write what is going on.

  + This is something that I do with my parents. I tend to struggle a lot with speaking or vocalizing about how I’m feeling (or just in general–let’s be real), so having the option to write stuff down breaks down a barrier between me and talking to my parents.
* “If you need me, I’m here. We don’t have to talk. We can just watch a show together.”

  + A couple of weeks ago, I had a really hard night. After I texted my parents about it, my dad just came into my room and asked me if I wanted to watch a show. Instead of pressuring me to talk to him about it (See? He’s learned!), I was able to feel safe and supported after I was vulnerable.
* Do a meditation, sound bath, massage, or other self-care experience together.

  + If you want a quick way to talk to your teenager about their feelings, this is the way to go. Doing these mental-health-oriented activities with your teenager can signal to your teen that you support them and notice that they are struggling.
* Give them ice cream or some other treat if they do talk to you about their emotions (AKA Pavlov).

  + This is kind of… manipulative? I’m not sure. But rewarding your kid when they do talk to you about their feelings makes them *want* to do it again.
