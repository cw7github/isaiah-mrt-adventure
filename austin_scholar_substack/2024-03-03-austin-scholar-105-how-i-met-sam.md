### Austin’s Anecdote: How I met Sam Altman

This last Monday, I had the absolute honor to meet the man of the year, Sam Altman.

Here’s the story: Three days after I got my wisdom teeth removed (I was probably not completely lucid, to be honest), I hopped on a plane to San Francisco with my ex-boss, David Perell for his *[How I Write](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFxhXLgGkVzKCn23_g8qM19DMDgco8eNJ)* interview with Sam Altman.

David has let me listen in on his interviews with some of my heroes (Sahil Bloom, Ali Abdaal, Tim Urban, and Tim Ferris), so he thought it would be a great opportunity for me to join his team for this one. I was, of course, honored.

When we reached the OpenAI building, I honestly think I was more nervous for the interview than David was. I won’t say too much else because I don’t want to spoil the episode when it goes live but here are a few of my own notes:

* The actual OpenAI building is so cool (Sam Altman is a fantastic interior designer)
* I was in Sam Altman’s line of sight for an entire hour
* Immediately after, I looked up OpenAI internships for Stanford students that don’t require coding skills (Seriously: the OpenAI culture seems amazing and the people were incredibly welcoming and kind. It made me want to work there.)

Overall, David wanted me to learn a couple of things from this experience – that successful people are both insanely cool and normal people, how messy live interviews can be (trying to stage the set, managing last-minute prep, scrambling when the printer stopped working, etc.), and what life could be like as a professional writer.

Now, how did I get this opportunity and why does David want to help me? It all started back in my sophomore year of high school when I took [Write of Passage](http://writeofpassage.com) (David’s online writing program) and David saw an ambitious teenager who loved to write – someone he could help.

Oftentimes, successful adults are willing to overinvest in ambitious teenagers – and will (like David) foster opportunities for teenagers to do further networking and get a jumpstart in their career or passion.

Keep reading to find out how and why – and how to replicate this for your kids.

### How your kid can meet their heroes, too

Successful people love to help ambitious kids. Why? Two reasons:

1. It makes them feel good
2. They have the ability to give the help and advice they wish they’d had

It’s kind of a mix of nostalgia and charity – neither of which are, of course, bad things at all.

And teenagers are the absolute perfect subset of people to support – old enough to be competent, but young enough to really need it and to inspire that *oh poor child* instinct in people that makes them want to help.

Your kid can – and should – take advantage of this.

The best way to do it is to have a big goal, and then reach out to their heroes.

Let me break it down:

The first step is to identify all of the cool people your kid looks up to and wants to be like. Of course, try to stay away from the mega-celebrities like Elon Musk or Taylor Swift – because they’re much harder to get an answer from. At the very least, go a step down and try, say, Jack Antonoff (Taylor’s producer and songwriter) instead of Taylor Swift herself.

You could find a TikToker who makes content similar to what you’d want to make, or a small business owner who lives in the same area as you. Maybe you could try an author who used to go to your high school, or a coder who’s posted a “how to code” series on YouTube.

But to get these people’s attention, you have to have your own crazy ambitious goal that they could help you with. Maybe you want to grow an audience to one million followers or sell a course to every college in your state. For more inspiration, check out my newsletter on [Masterpieces](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-80-what-is-a-masterpiece).

If you just reach out to someone famous and say 'hey, I love what you're working on, I'd love to talk sometime,' they won't see the connection between themselves and you. But if you're working on something already (which also signals that you have some skin in the game), it becomes clearer to them how they can be of help. Which makes them much more likely to answer.

Once you have a person and your goal, all that’s left is to be your best self.

Reach out to them (Twitter/X DMs, website form, email, etc.) and ask for their help or support.

Say something like this:

*Hey, my name is [Name].*

*I understand your time is valuable, so I’ll only write three bullet points:*

* *I’m [Age] years old.*
* *[Your goal]*
* *You’re [Why and how do you know them?], so I’d love to [Ask].*

*Thanks,[Name]*

Short, sweet, and punchy. Of course, this won’t guarantee a response, but Alpha kids have had some pretty awesome success. (If DM-ing doesn’t work, join any live sessions where the person you want to reach is speaking, or comment on their posts – basically just let them know that you exist. They’ll be a lot more likely to respond then :) )

Getting successful people to help you out as a kid will set you up later on in life, when you’re ready to officially start your career. Get ahead of the game and give yourself better chances by getting support from your heroes when they're most likely to be excited to help you.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

I got my wisdom teeth removed!! Luckily, I didn’t say anything *too* embarrassing and woke myself from the anesthetic pretty quickly. My sister, on the other hand, was completely out of it for a few hours. (Yes, we got the surgery together. Yes, I’m pretty sure my mom regretted that decision.) Anyway, I had three days of doing nothing but eating pudding for recovery. I, of course, spent this break productively – I slept for probably 48 hours straight and watched an entire season of The Bachelor, the second Black Panther movie, A Law Abiding Citizen, and Love is Blind: Sweden. Overall, not a bad week :)

1. [Equation-Based Writing](https://www.equationbasedwriting.com/)

Sorry, y’all, I’ve gotta self-promo again. If you missed the last few newsletters, I’m launching a course called Equation-Based Writing, where I’ll teach your STEM kids how to write well (and love writing!!) using what they know best: equations. You know how I use equations to help y’all talk to your kid? Well, it’s their turn to use equations to learn how to communicate their thoughts and ideas. Sign ups for the waitlist are open – and by the end of the week, there should be an official payment option and sign up form. I’m super excited about this course and hope y’all are too!

2. [Enlightened Life](https://peytonprice.substack.com/)

I can’t believe I haven’t talked about this yet, but one of my very best friends has started writing her own newsletter called Enlightened Life. She writes to you (parents!!) on how to use pop culture and entertainment to teach kids morality and values.

Peyton has such insightful takes on the world and how you can help your kid break past the decline in Gen Z’s view on morality. Definitely go check her out!!

3. [GUTS tour](https://www.austintexas.org/event/olivia-rodrigo-guts-tour/376474/)

Although I can’t claim to be the number one Olivia Rodrigo fan (that honor goes to my dad – he loves *get him back!* and *ballad of a homeschooled girl*), I’m beyond excited that one of the first stops on her GUTS tour was in Austin. Not only can you analyze her song lyrics to discuss morality and deeper meanings, but if you have a teen girl, Olivia Rodrigo could be the perfect source of intellectual debate.

Meet your kid where they’re at and use a pop star to learn about marketing (talk about the Crumbl collaboration?), branding (going from a Disney Channel star to respected artist), and cultural trends (could Olivia ever be the next Taylor Swift? why did Taylor stop supporting Olivia?).
