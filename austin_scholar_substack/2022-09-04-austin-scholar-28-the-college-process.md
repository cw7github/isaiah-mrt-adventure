### **Hey, y'all!**

When I went to Oxford, I got the download on everything I need to be thinking about as I start preparing my college applications for next year.

Of course, this seems very on-brand. "Austin goes to Oxford and gets college admissions advice. No surprises there."

But while most of you already know that I have my heart set on going to Oxford, it wasn't always that way. In fact, my journey to figure out where I want to go to school has been…lengthy.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: My college dreams throughout the years
2. The college process (from a college admission officer’s perspective)
3. Scholar’s Sources: My favorite resources on the college application process

Last week, all of my work at [Write of Passage: Liftoff](https://writeofpassage.school/) paid off. We did two focus groups, where ACTUAL HUMANS tested the exercises that I helped make?! It was one of the coolest, most surreal few hours of my life.

I also went to my first PBR (Professional Bull Riding, for those not in the know) event. I wasn’t expecting to love it as much as I did, but I guess that’s the Texan in me :)

I’ve been spending a lot of time on Twitter, too, so go follow [@AustinScholar.](https://twitter.com/AustinScholar)

### Austin’s Anecdote: My College Dreams Throughout the Years

*College was a way for me to be like my dad.*

When I was younger, all I wanted was to be like my dad: strong, successful, and smart.

And my dad had been singing the praises of Stanford to my sister and I since before we knew what college was.

He told us how at Stanford he met the people and made the connections that changed his life.

So, naturally, for the first few years of my life, Stanford was where I wanted to go. The ideal. The dream.

My life plan was as follows:

Get straight A’s in high school -> Get into Stanford -> Start a successful business.

Just like my dad.

I wanted to go on the same path as he did; I wanted to make him proud by being just like him.

And then, I started high school, and being like my dad was the *last* thing I wanted to do.

*College was a status symbol.*

For the first two years of high school, I had absolutely no idea who I was or what I wanted to do with my life.

Now that I didn’t have the “Straight A’s -> Stanford -> Successful Business” plan, I wasn’t totally sure what to do with myself.

But since that next step was only a couple of years away, figuring out my future became a lot more important.

So, I broke down what I *did* know:

1. I like getting good grades.
2. I want to go to a good college. (Isn’t that every hardworking high schooler’s goal?)

I wasn’t totally sure what “good” meant, but I’ve always had super high expectations for myself, so good quickly transformed into “the best.”

I still wanted to make my parents proud, and I still wanted to set myself up for success in whatever I decided to do with my life.

So I changed my plan:

Get straight A’s -> Get into an Ivy League -> Get a really good job.

I chose Ivy League schools because they're the best. I wanted the prestige of an Ivy League to make my parents proud and to give me a higher chance of getting a good job.

Really, I just wanted to be able to say, “I went to an Ivy League.”

*College is a place for me to be myself.*

And then [I went to a summer program at  Oxford](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-26-three-ways-to-get)–and my perspective on what college could be changed yet again.

At Oxford, I was able to become immersed in beautiful histories and experiences, while studying to become a better writer. I was immediately hooked. I realized  I want to go to college to fulfill my love of traveling and experiencing new cultures and places.

I want to go to college to study the English language and read and analyze old books and write hundreds of thousands of words.

I want to go to college to explore who I am and get a little bit closer to figuring out how I want to impact the world.

My current life plan:

Get straight A’s & grow Austin Scholar -> Go to college abroad -> Figure out what’s next

### The College Process (From a College Admission Officer’s Perspective)

DISCLAIMER: Obviously, I am no expert in college applications–I haven’t even sent in a single one (yet!).

I’m figuring this out as I go along.

I have, though, gotten the opportunity to talk to true experts in the college admissions process, and want to share the information and tips that I learn as I go.

And so, since, at Oxford, I got to speak with an actual college admissions officer, I thought I would share my super-detailed, practically-a-transcript, notes from his seminar.

*The college process (From a college admission officer’s perspective):*

**Tip #1: Relax**

“There are endless second chances. You’ll end up where you need to be.”

Even if college doesn’t happen to be the best choice right now, there are always online–or even adult–opportunities to get a degree. So take a breath and don’t put your future happiness in the hands of one tired admissions officer.

**When thinking about choosing a college…**

1. **Remember that college is not a campus. It’s a community of people.** The most important thing to do when deciding on a college is to talk to the people that you would surround yourself with.

   1. Talk to the professors

      1. Reach out to a department or two that you might be interested in. Try and talk to the head professor or administrator. Ask them “If I make a college visit, could we meet? I would love to hear more about this course and what you do.”
      2. Make sure that each program and major have a multitude of faculty, not just one professor. The more professors, the more expansive the program will be.
   2. Talk to the students

      1. Get into contact with recent alumni or current students. Ask them what the professors are like. How are the other students? Who do I want to be around? What seem to be the best courses to take? What do the graduates of this college actually do?
      2. If you tell them that you’re a high school student, chances are that any current student would love to answer your questions.
2. Focus on the essentials

   1. Your time at college isn’t going to be ruined because the gym is too small or the campus coffee shops aren’t good enough.
   2. Your time at college is going to be ruined if you hate the professors or can’t connect with any of your fellow students.
3. Take charge of the admissions process

   1. You’re the one going to college. Take initiative to do deep research into the place you’re going to spend four years of your life.

**When thinking about your college application…**

1. Be thoughtful and honest.

   1. Don’t just say: “I’m amazing. Look at everything I’ve done.”
   2. Show a sense of awareness of your own advantages and disadvantages.
2. You don’t have to be the perfect person.

   1. You just have to show that you are **open-minded, curious, eager, self-aware, and would bring a positive energy to the campus.**
3. Think about your situations and experiences in a new way.

   1. The important thing is *what* you’ve done and learned, not *that* you’ve done something or been somewhere.
   2. How has your passion and love of learning grown from each experience?
4. There’s no shame in saying, “I’m not sure what I want to do.”

   1. Just show that you take advantage of the opportunities you are given, are ambitious and hard-working, and have taken time to explore different interests and passions on a high level.
5. DO NOT SAY: “I’ve only ever wanted to be a...”

   1. To most college admissions officers, this shows an immature and fixed mindset. You want to show that you are willing to try new things and grow as an individual.

**Six Practical Tips**

1. There’s no law that says you can only apply to six colleges.
2. **Consider a gap year.**

   1. According to a Harvard study, students that took a year off before college did better academically than those who went straight after high school.
   2. It will improve your application.

      1. Finished senior year
      2. Final awards and distinctions
      3. Another year of maturity
      4. Have new, unique, and interesting experiences.
3. Once you’re in, seek out the professors.

   1. Go to office hours early in the semester. Get to know your professors without the threat of an exam.
   2. Go to professors whose courses you *might* want to take.
4. **Major in something you’re genuinely interested in.**

   1. Idealistic reason: You’ll live for a long time. You need things in your life that matter to you.
   2. Practical reason: You’ll get better grades in it.

      1. 3.7 GPA in English Literature student is *way* more likely to get into business school than a 2.0 GPA in Econ student.
      2. Colleges are always looking for diversity in their student population, so it’s always possible for an Art History major to get into medical school (it’s happened).
5. Scope out the campus.

   1. Go see all of the interesting places in the college.
   2. Find a job or internship.
6. Go to the foreign studies office.

   1. Figure out the requirements and possibilities for study abroad or future education programs early.

And finally, if you are worried about academic burnout, take a year off. **But if it feels like burnout, you might also be in the wrong field.**

### Scholar’s Sources: My Favorite Resources on the College Application Process

Since it’s my junior year, I’ve been spending a decent amount of time researching my next academic journey, and here are a few of the websites and articles that I found most helpful and that most clearly explained the college process.

[The Best Schools](https://thebestschools.org/) has a TON of really great resources for students in the college process and beyond. Pretty much every one of their articles has a clear “to-do” list and is super understandable. My personal favorite is their [“How to pick a college,”](https://thebestschools.org/resources/how-to-pick-a-college/) which gave me a very logical framework for thinking about different colleges. And yes–a lot of the categories seem pretty obvious (location, prestige, extracurricular, etc.), but for a stressed-out high schooler, having everything in one place helped organize my mind :)

As I’m sure you’ve picked up by this point, I *adore* traveling and would love to go to college abroad. [This article](https://www.mastersportal.com/articles/2099/how-to-pick-your-university-abroad-in-2022-6-essential-ways-to-decide.html) provided a great breakdown of the differences in the things I should be thinking about when going abroad instead of staying in the U.S. The article also provided search engines and portals specifically for searching for colleges abroad, and some places to start looking at for degrees and locations.

I’ve probably watched and read a hundred “What to put in your college application” videos and articles, and [this one](https://blog.prepscholar.com/what-looks-good-on-a-college-application) has to be my favorite. With a 7-step breakdown and action plan, this article is the perfect compression of all of the other 100 sources. Also, the 7-step plan seems very doable, even for a busy high school student running out of time to create a great college application.
