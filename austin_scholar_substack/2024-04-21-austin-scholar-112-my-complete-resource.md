### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: The story of my college application process
2. My complete resource list for crushing your college applications
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

This last weekend was absolutely incredible. To kick it off, my mom held her annual gala for [The Kindness Campaign](https://www.tkckindness.org/) and I got to dress up like Audrey Hepburn to present some of the gifts (what a dream). It was just so lovely to see everything she’s accomplished over the last year. I’m so proud to be her daughter <3

And then, I attended a Stanford admitted students event here in Austin, which was so cool. I got the chance to meet some of the people I’m going to spend the next four years with (which was so inspiring… and intimidating). The day showed me how close I am to leaving for college – to starting the next chapter of my life.

Which was also inspiring and intimidating.

### Austin’s Anecdote: The story of my college application process

On that note…since I’ve had some time to cool off after college admissions and get some distance (definitely necessary), I thought I’d take this newsletter to tell you my story of applying to college.

It will (hopefully) give you and your kid some resources and help in your own process.

I suppose my journey started the summer before my junior year when I did a two-week “study at Oxford” program.

From the very moment I stepped foot on campus, I had a new dream: to go to Oxford and write like my favorite authors.

When applying to college started to get real the next year, I immediately put Oxford, along with four other schools in the UK on my list. Any time someone mentioned applying to a US school “just in case,” I grimaced.

But still, I grudgingly decided to work on my application to Stanford, despite my adventurous spirit.

The work commenced: freshening up my transcript, making sure I had a challenging list of courses for my senior year picked out, getting my SAT score up to par, creating a list of the activities I’d done over the past few years, and drafting my essays.

While the US application – as we all know – gives students a big chance to showcase their non-academic achievements and skills, the UK application does not.

UK schools do not care about anything other than your academic capabilities.

And keep in mind – I’m a pretty solid student, but my real value and color show in what I do outside of school: from my newsletter, to Learn and Earn, to publishing writing, to being on podcasts.

The UK application doesn’t allow any of that to be shown.

So anyway: I’m putting my application together, and by September, college applications are pretty much the only thing on my mind. I’ve got my SAT score and know I’ve done cool things, but how can I curate them into a cohesive, engaging application that stands out from the tens of thousands of others?

Since the UK deadlines were first, I finished my essay about my love of reading and writing (which was literally so good, if I do say so myself) and sent off that application. As a whole, I do have to say that the UK process is a million times easier than the US process – every school uses the exact same application (grades, one teacher recommendation, one essay, all about one academic subject) and they’re all sent at the same time.

I actually received three acceptances within the first few weeks for my UK schools, which was so cool and made me more sure that going overseas was my path. But as y’all know, while I got to the interview stage for Oxford, my two interviews did not go too hot and I didn’t get in.

So it was time to turn all of my attention to the US applications.

I still wanted to apply to some good schools in the US in case the whole “overseas” thing didn’t work out.

In the US, I actually could include all my non-academic projects, but I had to find something to keep my application cohesive. I tied all of my activities to my “using my alternative educational experience to help others” theme to make the value of all of the activities clear.

And of course, I wrote ten different versions of my college essay before settling on one that talks about how I found my passion – something I was willing to struggle every day to work on. I thought it turned out really great.

And then there were the supplemental essays, which a lot of colleges use to make sure you’re actually a person and actually have interests. Here, I talked about ice skating, my love of baseball, different musicians I listen to, and other random, weird, memorable interests.

When I finally sent in my Stanford application, it managed to encapsulate who I am as a person and the value I’d bring to that campus – a whole lot more than my UK application ever did.

In the end, as y’all know, I was accepted, and Stanford was my decision.

For a few reasons:

1. It was the best-ranked school I got into
2. The people will be amazing
3. I can experiment more because of the flexible academic environment
4. I can be closer to my family

The things I dreamed of about Oxford and the UK ended up being the very reasons I didn’t *want* to go to those schools – you only study whatever your major is (I now want to experiment and try new things) and it’s a completely fresh start somewhere completely new (I’m already missing Austin; I can’t imagine having to worry about missing the entire country).

So the moral of the story: make sure your kid has options. They don’t know what they want when they’re seventeen. Give them space to figure it out.

### My complete resource list for crushing your college applications

Because of all of the 75% chance (of getting into an Ivy League) work I’ve done, I have a *lot* of resources to help your kid out.

Below I’ve collected all my top recommendations for your kid on their college application journey: from advice on how to build their transcript, to resources they can use to up their game.

I’ve separated them out into the different parts of a college application: academics, AP courses, SAT/ACT, Olympic-level project, audience building, other extracurricular activities, college essays, and miscellaneous.

**Academics**

* Freshman – Senior Year: Have a rigorous course load

  + College admissions officers are looking at your classes to see if you are taking the most difficult courses offered and choosing to put in hard work. They want to know that you take the initiative to challenge yourself.
  + Resources:

    - [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
    - [IXL](https://www.ixl.com/)
    - [What High School Courses Should I Take?](https://www.ivyscholars.com/2022/09/30/what-high-school-classes-should-i-take/)

**AP Courses**

* Freshman Year: If possible, take 1-2 easier AP courses

  + This will help you get the feel for what an AP course is like and what it takes to get a 5.
  + Recommended: Human Geography or Computer Science Principles
  + Resources:

    - [gt.school AP courses](https://gt.school/)
    - [College Board AP Daily videos](https://www.collegeboard.org/)
    - [Albert practice questions](https://www.albert.io/)
    - [Mr. Sinn YouTube videos (Human Geography)](https://www.youtube.com/@MrSinn)
    - [AP Live Review (Computer Science Principles)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42LzqpaVbw8&list=PLoGgviqq4844vbwcKegJgIxSQyVHDzSXT)
* Sophomore and Junior Year: Get a 5 on 3 hard AP courses

  + Try to complete as many hard AP courses before junior year as you can. Of course, many schools don’t offer AP classes to sophomores, so you can either use the [gt.school](https://gt.school/) program or start preparing for them early so that you won’t have to spend as much time on them in your Junior year, which will be crazy busy (trust me!!).
  + Yes, a “hard” AP course is relative, but there are some widely accepted as extremely challenging.

    - (Pass rate is not a good indicator of how challenging the AP is–consider that Calculus BC has a higher pass rate than Calculus AB.)
  + Recommended: English Language & Composition, English Literature & Composition, World History, U.S. History, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Calculus BC (based on [this](https://examstudyexpert.com/easiest-ap-classes/) and [this](https://blog.prepscholar.com/hardest-ap-classes-and-tests#:~:text=United%20States%20History%2C%20Biology%2C%20English,hardest%20AP%20classes%20and%20tests.) source).
  + Resources:

    - [gt.school AP courses](https://gt.school/)
    - [College Board AP Daily videos](https://www.collegeboard.org/)
    - [Albert practice questions](https://www.albert.io/)
    - [Fiveable](https://fiveable.me/)

**SAT/ACT**

* Freshman – Sophomore Year: Take at least five practice tests

  + Start getting into practice for the SAT/ACT early. Don’t wait until Junior year when you’re too busy with your extracurriculars and AP classes.
  + Make sure to take both the SAT and the ACT to see which one you like better.
  + Resources:

    - [Austin Scholar #94: How I got a 1600 on the SAT](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-94-how-i-got-a-1600)
* Junior Year: Take the official SAT/ACT

  + Take the SAT/ACT as many times as you need to get above a 1500 (and consider [superscores](https://blog.collegeboard.org/what-is-an-sat-superscore)), but keep in mind that 84% of Harvard applicants with a 1600 SAT score get rejected. Focus on spending your time where it will truly make a difference.

**Olympic-Level Project**

* Freshman – Senior Year: I’ve written a lot about having an [Olympic-level project in high school](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-92-y-school), and for a good reason. I wouldn’t have gotten into Stanford without mine – and my friends wouldn’t have gotten into Vanderbilt, Northeastern, USC, the UT business school, and the University of Austin without theirs. This is the hardest, but most valuable thing you can do.

  + Resources:

    - [Spike Lab](https://spikelab.com/)
    - [Apollo](https://apolloschool.io/)
    - [Prequel](https://joinprequel.com/)

**Audience Building**

* Freshman – Senior Year: Usually, an Olympic-level project requires you to [have an audience](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-84-how-to-help-your). This can be super hard, but I promise, it’s worth it.

    - [How to grow a TikTok account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7_YIURTcaY)

**Other Extracurricular Activities**

* Freshman – Senior Year: Participate in extracurricular activities that support your Olympic-level project

  + Resources:

    - [CollegeVine](https://www.collegevine.com/) – Use the CollegeVine simulation tool to explore what extracurricular activities you should be doing throughout high school. A good rule of thumb is to have one 1A level (your Olympic-level project) and two 2A/B levels that relate to your 1A project. The more cohesive your application is, the better. If the extracurricular isn’t a tier two, don’t spend much time on it, unless it’s just for fun. I, for example, still ice skated for fun even though I wasn’t competing at the national level because I genuinely enjoyed it. I didn’t expect it to help my application aside from giving me some personality in my supplemental essays.

      * For internships: After you’ve gained credibility through growing your audience, use your platform to reach out to experts directly about an internship.
      * For summer programs: Look for summer programs from a reputable entity that are already known for impressing colleges. Make sure the program aligns with your Olympic-level project.
      * For community service: The most impressive community service extracurriculars are the ones where you start your own initiative (minimum 100 participants). Regular community service is valuable in life, but not on your college application.
      * For school clubs: Hold a leadership position and bring your club to the national level in its field. Again, only participate in the clubs that relate to your theme.

**College Essay**

* Freshman Year: Write the first draft of your college essay

  + This will help you really figure out what you want to do with your time in high school. What do you want to have done before applying? What do you want to show to the admissions officers? What do you want your story to be?

    - Start with: Four years ago, I had the choice of either following a traditional high school path or going against the grain and doing something new. Here’s what I did:
* Junior Year: This is one of the [hardest parts of the application](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-85-to-be-passionate). My best advice would be to write as many drafts as possible and show the essay to as many experts as possible for edits. Ask your teachers, parents, and college counselor. Definitely tie it to your Olympic-level project. That’s where you’ll hook in the admissions readers.

  + Have at least *something* written before senior year so you have enough time to get high-quality feedback.

    - [50 Successful Harvard Application Essays](https://www.amazon.com/50-Successful-Harvard-Application-Essays/dp/1250127556)
* Senior Year: Complete edits to your essay!!

**Rest of Application**

* Junior Year: Start actually working on your application. You don’t want to rush any part of the process.

  + Make sure you visit schools throughout your junior year and think about where you want to apply. Consider location, school size, weather, opportunities offered, study abroad programs, cost, your major’s program, etc.
  + [The truth about recommendation letters](https://www.ivywise.com/ivywise-knowledgebase/resources/article/the-truth-about-recommendation-letters/) – try and ask for these before you leave for the summer. You want to make sure your teachers have enough time to write something great.
  + [Letters of Recommendation](https://www.cappex.com/articles/applications/letter-of-recommendation#:~:text=A%20letter%20of%20recommendation%20for,responsible%20when%20asking%20for%20them.)
* Senior Year: Finalize your applications and apply!

  + [How to write supplemental essays](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/supplemental-essays) – As I talked about earlier, make sure every supplemental essay showcases a different aspect of your personality or interests. If you talked about your hobby of knitting in one supplemental, don’t bring it up again. Talk instead about a different hobby or value.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [Children of Dune](https://www.amazon.com/Children-Dune-Chronicles-Book-Three/dp/0441104029)

Continuing on with my *Dune* streak, I finished the third book in the series. This one held a fascinating debate between a father and son about both the idea that “hard times make great men” *and* the challenge of hurting yourself – condemning yourself to a life of misery – for the greater good. Very very interesting discussion points and I can’t wait to see how it plays out in the fourth book!!

2. [The Poisonwood Bible](https://www.amazon.com/Poisonwood-Bible-Novel-Barbara-Kingsolver/dp/0060786507)

Since I’m a little bit of a faster reader than the friend I’m reading the *Dune* series with, I had a few extra days in between when I finished *Children of Dune* and when she did – so I couldn’t move onto the next book just yet. Instead, I picked back up *The Poisonwood Bible* and immersed myself in the incredibly vivid world of Barbara Kingsolver. This novel raises so many questions about religion, progress, history, culture… the list is endless. Absolutely worth a read if you want to spend some time just *thinking*.

3. [Axel practice example](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Iiav7BkGkcU)

This one is honestly more of a life update, but it’s too cool not to share.

Most of y’all probably know that I’m an ice skater – I’ve been skating for fun since 2021. And this Monday, I officially started doing my axel (which is the rite of passage for any aspiring figure skater into the world of being “good”). What’s even more awesome: I got to use a harness!! I was basically flying through the air as I tried to get 1.5 rotations in before I hit the ground. I did fall twice and was not able to actually land it, but my goodness, it was so incredibly fun. I can’t wait until tomorrow to get back onto the ice!!

**Thanks for reading. Go crush the week! See y'all on Sunday.**
