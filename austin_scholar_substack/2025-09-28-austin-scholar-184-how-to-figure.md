### **Hey, y’all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. How to figure out what you want to do with your life
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

I’m officially getting back into the groove of college life. It’s been fantastic seeing all of my friends again and I’m so happy to be back living with my roommate again! The people at Stanford really do make the experience incredible. I’d like to think that my classes have also been going well and I love my Mathematical Logic class – it’s technically a philosophy class on formal reasoning, but it also counts as a math core class. I can’t wait to see what my sophomore year brings!

### How to figure out what you want to do with your life

At the end of last term, I had a minor existential crisis in my dorm room at 2 AM.

I was scrolling through LinkedIn (how Bay Area of me), looking at all of my classmates with their fancy internships and clear career paths, and I realized: I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life.

Sure, I’m only just starting my sophomore year, but everyone else seems to have it figured out. My roommate’s been ready to go into politics for years. There are a ton of people in my dorm on the med school track. One of my friends worked at Meta this summer. And while I have lots of different things I enjoy doing, I don’t know what career path I want to focus on yet.

One of the reasons I chose this topic for the week is to force myself to set goals relating to my career and future. Because I love breaking things down into equations and logic, I needed something systematic.

So I created a three-step system that’s actually working. And I’m going to share it with you.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JhIz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4248dd1-6541-4bfe-809c-537cf6282aef_1600x84.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JhIz!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4248dd1-6541-4bfe-809c-537cf6282aef_1600x84.png)

Parents, before we dive into the strategy, this section is for you.

I know you’re worried. Your teen either seems stressed about their future or completely unconcerned. You want to help, but every conversation about “what do you want to do with your life” ends in shrugs, arguments, or “I don’t know” (my parents can relate to this for sure).

Here’s what’s actually happening: Your teen’s brain is doing exactly what it’s supposed to do.

Teenagers are neurologically programmed to:

* Explore multiple identities (that’s why they change interests every month)
* Seek purpose and meaning (but can’t articulate it yet)
* Push against external pressure (even good advice feels like control)
* Learn through experience, not instruction

Why your conversations aren’t going anywhere:

* They’re too narrow: “Pick a career” when they haven’t experienced 99% of what’s possible, and they know it
* They’re too pressure-filled: Making them feel behind if they don’t know what they want
* They’re too abstract: “Where do you see yourself in 10 years?” (They can barely plan next week!)

The system I’ll share below helps teens explore broad fields of interest – entire areas they’re curious about – rather than forcing them to narrow down to specific careers. This makes a huge difference in their level of stress (and analysis paralysis):

* Career focus: “I need to become a doctor.” This feels full of pressure, like you’re choosing a rigid path, unable to change your mind
* Field focus: “I’m interested in how the human body works.” This feels like an exploration, with multiple paths and freedom to pivot

Your role as a parent is simple: support your kid’s exploration without applying pressure to their process.

**DO:**

* Do your own values pie chart (model vulnerability)
* Fund books and experiments without strings attached
* Ask “What did you learn?” not “Did you like it?”
* Celebrate exploration, even “failed” experiments
* Share your own career pivots and uncertainties

**DON’T:**

* Express disappointment if they don’t like what you expected
* Rush them through the process
* Compare their exploration to others
* Attach college or career outcomes to their discoveries
* Say “You used to love X, what happened?” (Interests change!)

This system teaches meta-skills that matter regardless of career:

* How to research systematically
* How to reach out to experts
* How to test assumptions
* How to track what energizes them
* How to make decisions with incomplete information

These skills are more valuable than picking the “right” career at 16.

If they seem resistant, start by doing the values pie chart yourself. Share it with them. Be honest about how your values have changed over time. Make it a conversation, not a lesson. Sometimes teens need to see parents as humans figuring things out too.

Remember: a teen who explores three fields and rejects them all has learned more about what they like than one who picked “doctor” at 12 and never questioned it.

**Step 1: The Values Pie Chart**

I’ve talked about this exercise *a lot* – and for a good reason. The Values Pie Chart changed everything for me.

Most goal-setting starts with “What do you want to achieve?” But that’s backwards. It should start with “What do you actually care about?”

Here’s exactly how to create your Values Pie Chart:

1. Brain dump everything that matters to you into a document – friends, family, grades, sports, creative projects, health, your future, making money, helping others, having fun. Don’t filter yet.
2. Group similar items into 4-6 major categories. For example, “hanging with friends” and “hanging out with family” might both go under “spending time with loved ones.”
3. Assign percentages based on importance. This is the hard part. You only have 100% to distribute. If relationships get 40%, you only have 60% left for everything else. Be honest – not what you think you should value, but what actually makes you feel fulfilled.

My Values Pie Chart looks like this:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kxbz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c1ef8a3-95a1-4edb-aeb8-9c115e57519d_1110x304.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kxbz!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c1ef8a3-95a1-4edb-aeb8-9c115e57519d_1110x304.png)

* **Time with loved ones (30%)**: Nothing makes me feel more fulfilled than laughing with my sister and recapping my day with my roommate
* **My future (25%)**: I feel proud when I’m investing in tomorrow-me
* **Passion & purpose (25%)**: Finding what lights me up inside (like this newsletter!)
* **Health (10%)**: Taking care of my body and mind
* **Academics (10%)**: Challenging my brain and crushing those assignments

Now here’s the important part – turning values into goals:

For each pie slice, create 2-3 specific, measurable goals that honor that percentage. If relationships are 40% of your pie, but you only have one vague goal about “staying in touch,” you’re not prioritizing your time correctly.

Let’s say you’re awake 16 hours a day (8 hours sleep). That’s 112 hours per week. Break down your percentages into time allotments:

* 30% for relationships = 34 hours/week
* 25% for future = 28 hours/week
* 25% for passion = 28 hours/week
* 10% for health = 11 hours/week
* 10% for academics = 11 hours/week

Your 2-3 goals per category should roughly fit into these time allotments. Here’s an example of how I broke mine down:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RS1f!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff905749e-d313-4e69-b251-39e5249efd70_1196x614.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RS1f!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff905749e-d313-4e69-b251-39e5249efd70_1196x614.png)

**Time with loved ones (30% = ~34 hours/week):**

* Call family daily: 30 min x 7 = 3.5 hours
* Eat dinner with friends 4x/week: 2 hours x 4 = 8 hours
* Coffee with non-dorm friends weekly: 2 hours
* Call home friends weekly: 30 mins x 4 = 2 hours
* Weekend hangouts: ~18 hours
* **Total: ~33.5 hours**

**My future + academics (35% = ~40 hours/week):**

* Read 1 investing book/week: 4 hours
* Create investment proposal monthly: 4 hours/week
* Academics: (unfortunately working on my academics is still investing in my future!): >32 hours
* **Total: ~40 hours**

Most kids might not value academics, but I bet they value their future or want to get into the college of their dreams, so it’s still important to be honest about how short-term things like academics are necessary for your long-term goals.

To look at it all put together, check out [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vKsJ6rhvYVbyPHF74Mu27nhL1JMboDUqseCuGXQAAK0/edit?usp=sharing) with my full Values Pie Chart and goals.

**Step 2: Using AI**

Okay, this is where it gets interesting.

I took my values pie chart and fed it to ChatGPT and Claude, asking them to recommend career paths that align with my values and strengths.

Here’s the exact prompt you can give your kid:

*I’m a [age] year old [grade level] student exploring fields of interest that might become future careers. Please analyze my profile and suggest 10 different fields that align with my values and natural interests.*

*MY VALUES (from most to least important):*

*- [Value 1 - X%]: [Brief description of why this matters]*

*- [Value 2 - X%]: [Brief description]*

*- [Continue for all values]*

*MY STRENGTHS:*

*- [List 3-5 things you’re naturally good at]*

*- [Include both academic and personal strengths]*

*WHAT ENERGIZES ME:*

*- [List 3-5 activities that make you lose track of time]*

*- [Include hobbies, not just school subjects]*

*WHAT DRAINS ME:*

*- [List 3-5 activities that exhaust you even thinking about them]*

*SUBJECTS/TOPICS I’M CURIOUS ABOUT:*

*- [List classes, YouTube rabbit holes, books you actually finish]*

*MY GOALS/DREAMS:*

*- [Include practical goals like “financial independence by 30”]*

*- [Include personal goals like “work-life balance” or “helping others”]*

*For EACH of the 10 fields:*

*1. Explain WHY this field matches my profile*

*2. List 5 books to start exploring (mix of fun and serious)*

*For the TOP 3 fields that best fit my profile:*

*1. Detailed explanation of the match*

*2. The 5 books with descriptions of what I’ll learn*

*3. Three concrete experiments I could try this month*

*4. People/experts to follow online*

*5. What types of problems I’d solve in this field*

*6. Honest downsides to consider*

*Remember: I’m exploring INTERESTS, not committing to careers. Make it exciting and exploratory, not pressure-filled.*

When I did this myself I edited the prompt a bit to fit a college student, but it’s the same idea. Interestingly, both AIs came back with the same top three matches for me:

1. Equity Research

Because I love diving deep into data and making connections others might miss. Plus, it combines analytical thinking with storytelling.

2. Management Consulting

Perfect for someone who likes variety, problem-solving, and working with different types of people and industries.

3. Educational Technology Strategy

This one surprised me, but it makes sense – combining my passion for education with strategic thinking about the future of learning.

Each recommendation came with 5 book suggestions, which leads into the final step.

**Step 3: The BrainLift**

Here’s where most people stop. They get the recommendations, maybe buy a book, and then... nothing.

But not us! It’s time to create a “BrainLift” for each field of interest.

I’ve talked about BrainLifts before, but here’s a quick summary: a BrainLift is like building a second brain for any topic you want to master. It’s a structured knowledge framework with four major components that helps you go from “I think this is interesting” to “I actually understand this deeply.” You can build one on any topic you find interesting. Starting out takes only a couple hours to do, and you can build it in anything – a Google Doc or your favorite note-taking database.

Think of it as your personal research headquarters.

**Step 1. PURPOSE** Start by writing WHY you’re exploring this field. This keeps you focused when things get overwhelming.

**Step 2. EXPERTS** Create a list of 5-10 people/organizations who are crushing it in this field. These become your learning filters.

For each expert, document:

* **Who:** Their credentials and achievements
* **Focus:** What specific area they’re known for
* **Why Follow:** What unique perspective they bring
* **Where:** Twitter handle, blog, books, YouTube channel

Your expert list can start with the authors of the books ChatGPT recommended to you. Use the “Who” to fill in their information, and summarize the book in the “Why Follow” section. If you found their perspective or writing style interesting, you can research them more and follow them on social media.

If your interest in this field is piqued, you can ask ChatGPT “Who are the top 10 experts in [field] that a student should follow?” Then research each one.

If you’re not too into this field, you can stop here. However, if you do like what you’re doing, keep moving on to the next steps:

**Step 3. SPIKY POVs** You can start this stage in the middle of your research, or you can wait until after you finish, but I find that if I’m excited about what I’m learning this starts to happen naturally while I’m still researching. Spiky POVs are controversial or surprising insights that challenge conventional wisdom.

Developing Spiky POVs shows that you actually understand the field beyond surface level. You’re not just repeating what other people say, you’re having opinions of your own.

Create two lists: **TRUTHS** (unexpected realities about the field) and **MYTHS** (what everyone believes but isn’t true).

As you start digging into your reading and doing additional research, add to your lists of POVs each time you have a new insight.

This step will take a while, but you’ll start to develop some really interesting ideas if you keep with it.

**Step 4. KNOWLEDGE TREE** Organize everything you’ve learned into categories. Each category should have:

* **Sources:** Books, articles, videos you’ve consumed
* **Key Facts:** Bullet points of important information
* **Insights:** What surprised you or changed your thinking
* **Experiments:** Small projects you tried

**Why BrainLifts?**

Traditional career exploration: “Read about it -> Talk to someone -> Hope you like it”

BrainLifts: “Define purpose -> Learn from experts -> Challenge assumptions -> Test with experiments -> Make informed decision”

The difference? You’re not just learning *about* the field – you’re thinking about the field like someone already in it. By the time you finish, you’ll know if this is your thing or not. And you can repeat for the next interesting recommendation.

And that’s it!

One final note I’ll leave you to ponder: going through this process isn’t really about finding the perfect career. That’s what this is applied to in this example. but you can use the same process to solve any other problem.

It’s about learning how to make decisions when you can’t see the future. It’s about building confidence through small experiments instead of giant leaps. It’s about knowing yourself well enough that external pressure can’t knock you off course.

So to my fellow confused college students, to the stressed high schoolers, to anyone who feels behind because they don’t have it figured out: you’re not behind. You’re just still building. And now you have a blueprint.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

Over the summer, I had the absolute pleasure of meeting [Jenny Just](https://www.jennyjust.com/), one of the few female self-made billionaires in the United States. She’s an incredible inspiration for me as I continue on my investing journey and I truly hope to learn a lot from her. One of Jenny’s newest ventures is [Poker Power](https://www.pokerpower.com/), an organization that teaches employees (but primarily women!) the game of poker so they can “lead with confidence, make sharper decisions, and take smarter risks — in work, life, and everything in between.”

Right now, Poker Power is looking to expand into universities across the US, and my roommate and I are going to be the ambassadors for Poker Power at Stanford and will create the first Stanford Women in Poker (name in progress!) club where we provide Poker Power lessons and a community to practice the life skills of confidence, communication, negotiation, risk, resilience, leadership, and so many more that poker teaches you.

If this seems at all interesting to you, I highly recommend checking out the Poker Power [website](https://www.pokerpower.com/) and [signing up for a lesson](https://www.pokerpower.com/beginner-poker-strategy) or downloading the free [Poker Power app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/poker-power-play/id1559404571) to practice online and with friends. Poker Power also provides lessons to companies and private lessons along with the group lessons. I truly believe there is so much you can learn from poker and I can’t wait to expand the program at Stanford!

As a sneak peak, here are a few of the tips I’ve gotten during the first Poker Power lesson:

* Aggression is a winning strategy because it puts pressure on your opponents – usually the one willing to be most aggressive will win the pot
* Fold ~80% of the time
* So what hands should you play?

  + Pairs
  + High cards (10-A)
  + Suited connectors
* Your goal is always to get other people to fold. You can do this by being aggressive and showing that you like your cards.
* Only re-raise with Aces, Kings, Queens, Ace-King

  + Re-raise to 3-4x initial raise
* Initial raise should be 3x the big blind
* First bet should be 1/2 pot
* If you’re the first person to enter the pot, never call. However, if someone raises before you, you can call.

  + Beginning with a call signals weakness.
  + Raising is telling your opponents you like what you have.
* You want to be consistent with your raise (ex. always 3x the big blind).

  + This makes it harder to read you, which will allow you to bluff.
