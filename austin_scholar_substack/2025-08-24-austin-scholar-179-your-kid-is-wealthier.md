### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Your kid is wealthier than Warren Buffett. Teach them to invest, not spend.
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

Now that my friends are mostly back at college (and I'm the last holdout in Austin before I head back to Stanford), I'm missing them a lot, but it also has me reflecting on how special it is to still feel so close to them even while we're scattered all over the country. And y’all know what that reminded me of? That growing up in the Alpha program gave us a bond like no other. My friends and I have gone through so much together – we literally helped build a whole school from the ground up. Even when we've been apart all year, we're able to come back together and talk like no time at all has passed, and I have a feeling it's going to be that way forever.

I am grateful to Alpha for many things, but perhaps the most important is the friends that I made. I love them all so, so much and can’t wait to see where their journeys lead them.

### Your kid is wealthier than Warren Buffett. Teach them to invest, not spend.

Warren Buffett is worth about $130 billion. Your 12-year-old? They're infinitely wealthier.

I know that sounds ridiculous. Bear with me.

I've recently been thinking a lot about Sahil Bloom's concept of "Time Wealth" from his book *[The Five Types of Wealth](https://www.the5typesofwealth.com/)*. While Sahil defines it as having the freedom to choose how you spend your time, who you spend it with, and what you trade it for, I think there's a crucial piece missing from most conversations about this concept: **kids are the ultimate time millionaires.**

Think about it. Warren Buffett, at 94, has accumulated incredible financial wealth, but his time wealth is rapidly depleting. Your child, whether they're 8 or 18, has something Buffett would pay any amount for: decades of runway ahead of them.

But here's the kicker: most kids (and their parents) have no idea how rich they actually are. It's been a while since I've taken up my role as [Sahil Bloom's teenage translation engine](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-47-life-advice-from), but this topic is important, so let's dive in.

Let’s start with actual financial investing as an example. If an individual starts investing $100 a month in the S&P 500 at 40, they’ll have ~$70,000 by the time they retire. But if they start investing the same amount at age 21, they’ll have $500,000+ by the time they retire. The difference is staggering: and the same principle applies to skill development, habit formation, and relationship building.

**The earlier you start, the more time you have to compound.**

This is exactly why I love the way Alpha structures its school days, with academics in the morning and life skills in the afternoons. Alpha is helping kids invest their time wealth into skills that will compound for decades: grit, public speaking, entrepreneurship, coding, financial literacy. These aren't just "nice to haves", they're investments with a 50+ year runway to grow.

Learning to public speak at 60 might lead to some fun speaking opportunities, but starting your speaking journey at 17 gives you time to build skills that could eventually lead to six or seven figures in public speaking revenue – sometimes per year, when a career has advanced far enough.

Sahil talks about the three pillars of time wealth: Awareness, Attention, and Control. For kids, I'd think about these pillars as follows:

**Awareness:** Teaching kids to see their current freedom as the superpower it is, not something to waste on endless scrolling or passive entertainment.

**Attention:** Helping them focus their abundant energy on activities that build rather than just consume.

**Control:** Guiding them to make decisions that their future selves will thank them for.

Using these pillars as a base, here are some practical ways to help your child invest their time wealth:

* **Saturday skills**: 2-hour blocks every week where they learn one concrete skill such as origami, basic coding with Scratch, cooking a simple dish, or building something with their hands
* **Build a business**: Help them start a tiny venture: lemonade stand, pet-sitting for neighbors, or selling handmade crafts. Start teaching them how to manage their money when they’re young.
* **Stick-to-it-ness goal**: Set a goal that requires practice for 10 minutes daily. Could be learning the splits, a song on the piano, a complicated hairstyle, etc.
* **Tradition time:** Not everything has to be about learning. Start creating traditions with your kids while they’re young so that they know that they are always a priority to you. Some examples: Mom spends an hour every Friday night learning to play Fortnite with her son, Mom spends Sunday night doing her daughter’s hair to start the week off right, Dad bakes a dessert Saturday nights with his daughter, or Dad reads a comic book with his son on Wednesday nights.

As kids get older, the skills, business, and goals can get more complicated and interesting – run a mile in eight minutes, read fifty books on investing, edit YouTube videos, post daily on X, learn how to sail, recreate a meal from your favorite restaurant, enter competitions… the list goes on.

If you communicate to your kid the ideas of compounding and time wealth when they’re young, not only will they be able to begin developing great skills, but they’ll start to learn to connect their time with “wealth.” It won’t happen immediately, but they will slowly learn that their time is valuable and that so much can be done with it. If this becomes common terminology in your household, it will be easier later on to set boundaries with your kid on unhealthy habits (e.g. screen time) because they will understand that you are trying to help them invest their time, not spend it (even if they don’t like it).

As I said before, of course, not every single moment must be productive – in fact, having time wealth also means that you can afford to waste a little of it. Also, watching shows or playing video games with friends and running around the house playing fairies are often easy ways to build relationships with other kids and make friends, so I wouldn’t say that time is “wasted” either. The main idea is to give your kid a framework to think about how they spend their time and how they can invest their time by creating skills and building projects that will compound over time.

I truly can’t express the power of compounding enough. Every day your child delays investing their time wealth, they're getting relatively poorer.

Not because time is running out (they have plenty), but because the compound interest clock is ticking. The 10-year-old who starts coding today will have 10+ years of experience by the time they're college-aged. The 14-year-old who starts a small business now will understand systems, failure, and resilience in ways their peers won't grasp until their twenties.

This isn't about pressuring kids or stealing their childhood. It's about helping them see that their current freedom is their greatest asset.

Here’s a quick exercise to get them started:

**The Time Wealth Audit Exercise**

Sit down with your child and map out their typical week. How much time goes to:

* Required activities (school, meals, sleep)
* Consumption (TV, social media, games)
* Creation and skill-building
* Relationships and play

Ask them if there’s an area they want to spend more time on, or somewhere they didn’t realize that they were spending so many hours in. How can you help them manage this? What do they think about their schedule and how they’re spending their time now that it’s so clearly laid out? Diving into how they’re spending their time is a great way to begin building awareness of time wealth that Sahil talks about – understanding that time is finite and precious, even when you have a lot of it. If you want to go even deeper on this, you can pair this exercise with the values pie chart I've written about in [previous articles](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-46-how-to-set-your).

Your job isn't to manage your child's time wealth. Rather, it's to help them become conscious investors of it. This means:

* Celebrating effort and growth, not just natural talent
* Connecting their current interests to long-term possibilities
* Modeling intentional time use in your own life
* Creating environments where skill-building is normal and expected

Remember: your child is sitting on a goldmine of time wealth. Warren Buffett, despite all his financial success, would probably trade everything to have what your kid has right now: decades of opportunity ahead of them.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Dr. K Explains: The Science of Self Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgRSfhoHE4g)

This is a *super* special source because about a week ago, my roommate sent me a text saying that she really enjoyed this video and thought it could make a good Scholar’s Source. I love her so much and adore that she reads my newsletters and thinks about what I should write about! So, I wanted to do an extra great analysis of this video as tribute to her. (I even took notes throughout the video like it was a lecture.)

Here are my key takeaways from the video:

* Self-control isn’t a personality trait you’re born with; it’s a diminishing resource that can be depleted by stress and emotional regulation.
* The true mechanism of self-control is the brain’s ability to monitor internal conflict, specifically in the anterior cingulate cortex. When you stop monitoring internal conflict (the mental battle between impulse and discipline), self-control fades.
* Suppressing emotions or enduring stress draws your attention outward or shuts down internal cues, weakening your ability to monitor conflict and therefore control yourself.youtube
* Awareness of your internal state and conflicts is not just a precursor to self-control – it *is* self-control. Increasing internal awareness directly enhances your capacity for self-discipline.
* Meditation works because it heightens awareness of internal states (like breath or feelings), which strengthens the conflict monitoring "muscle." You don’t need formal practice; simply paying attention to your inner conflict boosts control.
* Reducing emotional turbulence (through therapy, journaling, or healthy coping mechanisms) bolsters self-control. If you’re emotionally overwhelmed, start there before addressing behavior change.
* You do not need to eliminate all stressors, but you must periodically "re-internalize" awareness by checking in with yourself, especially when stressed. Take 15-30 minutes to consciously notice your hunger, fatigue, or feelings.
* Practice being aware of inner battles – notice when you want to give into impulses and observe the conflict. Don’t try to suppress or "just do it"; just pay attention. The longer you do this, the more control you will feel.
* Simple breath or mindfulness exercises that increase awareness of internal states effectively increase self-control. No need for elaborate rituals – focus on noticing, not forcing, change.

2. Being mindful in frustrating situations

When I was in Dallas to watch the Texas Rangers play eight games of baseball, my patience was tested. Why? The Rangers lost *six games*. How brutal is that?! I come all of the way down to Dallas just to watch my team lose almost every night. (I will admit, though, that the two games we won were incredibly exciting games, so not all was lost.) About halfway through our losing streak, I was spending the entire night ranting about how bad the team is and talking to my dad about how we can’t seem to ever win. However, I realized that although ranting and being angry can be fun for a short amount of time, being at peace is *way* more fun in the long run. Although I automatically get pretty fired up about umpire calls, stupid strikeouts, and bad fielding, I needed to let go of my negativity and reframe the situation. I’m so lucky to be able to spend that time in Dallas with my dad and don’t want that experience to be remembered as an angry one. So during the next few games, I did my favorite mindfulness exercises ([5-4-3-2-1,](https://insighttimer.com/blog/54321-grounding-technique/) [mindful eating](https://clearviewtreatment.com/resources/blog/borderline-personality-disorder-treatment-mindful-eating-html/), [square breathing](https://www.bsu.edu/-/media/www/departmentalcontent/counseling-practicum-clinic/pdfs-new-website/square-breathing.pdf?), and reminding myself that I should also be grateful).

As silly as this sounds, I promise that it was a *much* better experience. I watched the next game with my friend (we lost, of course), and we were laughing the entire game; instead of getting mad at the players’ incompetence on the field, we found it hilarious. García strikes out for the third time? I’m betting on a 0-4 game-ending strikeout next. Garcia makes the most ridiculous throw I’ve ever seen and reminds me why pitchers shouldn’t try and field every play? The crowds’ faces are killing me. We left the game not caring that we didn’t win; instead loving that we got to have that experience together. No matter how much fun it is to rant about everything wrong in your life, mindfulness and reframing always come out on top.

3. [Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits by Phillip A. Fisher](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Stocks-Uncommon-Profits-Writings/dp/0471445509)

I’m not going to lie: when I read the name of this book I buckled in for a book more on the dense, boring side of investing books. I couldn’t be more happy to be wrong. I *loved* this book and absolutely understand why Warren Buffett was so inspired by Fisher (he says his own style is a mix of Benjamin Graham and Phillip Fisher). The general idea of the book is to not just focus on investing in companies at a good price, but on investing in *good companies themselves*. Fisher has developed a multitude of ways to figure out what a good company is (such as the 15-points framework and the scuttlebutt method) that are now so much easier to use because of the internet, social media, and AI. These methods, of course, require so much more time, effort, and expertise than simply checking the P/E ratio, but they will definitely pay off. If you’re interested in learning more, I had Claude make an [analysis of the book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ieYRrqYbFwtkRoPhmOvEqZ7h5KGwQq3A/view?usp=sharing) that I’m definitely going to use for my own reference.
