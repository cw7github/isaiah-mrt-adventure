### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: I got rejected from Oxford (but it didn’t destroy me)

After the events of this week, I wanted to give myself a little bit of grace and keep this newsletter short and sweet for y’all. I hope you still enjoy :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: I got rejected from Oxford (but it didn’t destroy me)

Six years ago, I got a B in a college accounting class.

To me, that meant I was “B”-level. As a person.

Trust me, I understand how ridiculous this sounds – a tiny little sixth-grade girl “upset” about not getting an A in a college class. *What a try-hard*.

But I’d always been known as the girl who gets As. When we did exercises at school where we’d compliment each other, every time, without fail, I would get told that I was smart.

I’m in no way complaining about this. But I’d pretty closely attached “smart” and “100%” and “A” to who I was as a person.

And then in sixth grade, that was taken away from me. I could no longer say I was a perfect student. And to me, not perfect meant failing, which meant I was a failure.

That thought process (that [twisty thought](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-34-the-science-of)) stuck with me. I obsessed over it. Every time something didn’t work out exactly how I wanted or I didn’t check every item off my to-do list, I was a failure. I wasn’t good enough (and would never be good enough).

It might seem obvious, but this is an absolutely terrible mindset and made me constantly sad and anxious.

Today, I got rejected from Oxford University.

But instead of *me* being terrible and a reject and a failure who will never succeed in anything ever, I’m just disappointed.

Yes, I’m a little sad, but I know I put my all into that application and that I’m not defined by my acceptance or rejection.

When my first thought after reading the letter was “that sucks, but I’ll be okay,” I knew that I’d grown. (Seriously, who is this version of me and where did she come from?!)

I learned how to feel secure in myself – to not get my self-worth from my accomplishments or failures, but from my values and actions.

I know this seems like a radical shift, so here are some tips (for both parents and kids) on how to achieve this mindset:

For the kids:

1. One thing

The easiest way to start building up self-assurance is to recognize the things you’re already doing. Every day, write down one thing that you are proud of – or at the very least pleased with yourself for – doing. It doesn’t have to be big.

In the beginning, mine were “I got to school on time today” and “I liked my outfit,” but they eventually became things like “I wrote a great tweet” and “I did my best on the practice test.” Then, you can never say that you were a failure that day because there’s always at least one thing you did that’s good.

2. Stop with the negative jokes

It has been increasingly common for people to say things like “I want to kill myself” and “I hate everything” and “I fail at everything.” Stop. Saying. That. Stuff. It will eventually become internalized and you’ll start believing it.

Don’t hurt yourself from something that’s avoidable.

3. Take space

If something does happen that sucks, distance yourself from the situation. Do this in two ways:

1. Mentally: Say things like “I’m noticing that I’m really upset that I didn’t get a good grade” instead of “I failed.” This creates space in your mind from the event and detaches the word “fail” from yourself.
2. Physically: Move around and distract yourself. Put yourself in a different space from where you were when the bad thing happened. In a few hours, it won’t hurt as much.

For the parents:

1. Tell your kid you’re proud

Tell your kid you’re proud of them – but not just when they accomplish something. At the end of every day (or just whenever you think to), say “I’m proud of you.” Help them to stop associating your pride and belief in them with just good grades and awards.

2. Text your kid

Starting to text my parents is the best thing that’s happened to our relationship. Read more about it [here](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-53-how-texting-saved).

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been reading…

1. [The Cartiers](https://www.the-cartiers.com/)

After reading *Cat’s Cradle* last week, to continue with my resolution to read one “book of literary or intellectual merit” each week, I picked up *The Cartiers*. And my goodness am I loving every moment. It’s an extremely dense book – and with over 500 pages, it’s definitely a commitment. But I’ve seriously learned so much (and not just about jewelry). The piece is filled with insights on keeping a business in the family, doing things that don’t scale, how marketing has changed, the power of quality, finding innovation in unexpected places, and so much more. *The Cartiers* is definitely worth a read.

2. [How I Write - Time Urban](https://x.com/david_perell/status/1742539591641399476?s=20)

Something I’m incredibly grateful for is that [David Perell](https://perell.com/) allows me to sit in during some of the *How I Write* podcast filming, meaning that I get to meet really cool people. Most recently, I got to meet Tim Urban ([Inside the mind of a master procrastinator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU) TEDTalk guy), whose podcast episode had me smiling the whole time. The power of networking and building relationships is truly unmatched.

3. [The Night Circus audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Night-Circus-Audiobook/B005HIR9VI)

Something to know about me is that whenever I’ve had a bad day or can’t sleep, I put on *The Night Circus* audiobook. I’m not totally sure how this trend started, but all I can say now is that I have the entire first chapter of this book memorized (in the same accent as the audio, of course) and the words instantly bring me comfort. This week I was able to refresh my memorization :)
