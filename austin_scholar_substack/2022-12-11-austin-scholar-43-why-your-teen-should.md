### **Hey, y'all!**

I spent months feeling terrified about writing on Twitter.

I did everything I could to avoid it. I didn't know why, but I thought it was going to make my life terrible.

Just a few months later, Twitter has become one of my favorite parts of my day. In this issue, I'm going to tell you all about what changed.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I Become A Twitter Person
2. Why Your Teen Should Write On Twitter (& How To Get Started)
3. Scholar’s Sources: My Favorite Resources For Writing Online

I posted [a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/AustinScholar/status/1599529404962672642?s=20&t=WZzzXr_xBjdXof0pNkdtfg) last Sunday and cold DM’d it to a bunch of super cool people. You might remember me saying last week that I was nervous about sending DMs, and I’m super proud that I moved past my anxiety and sent them. (And I got a great response–[Sahil Bloom](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom), [Cultural Tutor](https://twitter.com/culturaltutor), [David Perell](https://twitter.com/david_perell), [Ana Lorena Fabrega](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11), and [Nick Huber](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup) all commented on my tweet!)

One more important update: [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is pretty much the coolest thing in the entire world. I’ve spent the week asking ChatGPT to rewrite a Taylor Swift song in the style of a Shakespearean sonnet and to write a satirical essay on coffee. (And don’t judge me–I definitely used it for this newsletter :) )

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I Become A Twitter Person

I am not a people person.

I don't think I've ever really understood how to answer questions or how to keep conversation flowing.

And in almost every area of my life, that's okay.

My sister talks enough for both of us, my friends are used to my awkwardness, and I don't have to talk *back* to people for my newsletter–only *to* them.

It's all manageable–except for Twitter.

I've been informed by what seems like hundreds of people that getting Twitter followers is the best way to get newsletter subscribers.

But Twitter is just... really hard for me.

For months after I published my first newsletter, I had all these excuses for why I shouldn't start my Twitter account for Austin Scholar yet.

*AP exams are coming up, so I won't have any time for Twitter.*

*I don't know how Twitter works.*

*I haven't posted enough newsletter editions for people to want to subscribe.*

But the truth is: I was scared. I was terrified that I would say the wrong thing to the wrong person. Or that I would never get any followers. Or that I wouldn't know how to respond to a comment. So, I just... didn't try. And my newsletter didn't grow.

I spent weeks writing and publishing to no one. I knew something had to change.

The next week, I spent hours perfecting my first Twitter thread, swapping commas for dashes and searching for the right words. (Next week's newsletter is going to be on perfectionism, so watch out for that.)

After the thousandth lecture from my dad on why I needed to start posting on Twitter, I gave in and published my first thread.

And you know what? Nothing really happened. I got some likes and retweets and followers–and I even got my first hate comment within the first 24 hours of posting on Twitter. But after posting the first thread, nothing in my life really changed. I didn't get an award for the followers. The hate comment wasn't broadcast on every billboard in Austin.

I was pleasantly surprised.

So, I posted another thread the next week. A tweet here and there. Another thread. Occasionally a few comments. (These are still the hardest for me. I had to use templates of other people’s comments in order to even start commenting on other threads.)

And then, I started to notice that Twitter was actually making my life better.

I got a DM from someone who asked me to be on a podcast. Another from someone who wanted to have a conversation with me about Alpha’s curriculum. I received multiple emails from parents asking me about adaptive learning. *Sahil Bloom* and *Ana Lorena Fabrega* commented on one of my threads after I cold DM'd them. (Still the most insane moment of my life.)

Now, I can send people (and college admissions officers!) over to my Twitter account and feel pretty cool because I have over 1,000 followers.

All of these things were possible because I took the leap and published on Twitter. And who knows? After a few years, I might become better at talking to people in real life, too.

### Why Your Teen Should Write On Twitter (& How To Get Started)

These are two commonly accepted truths:

1. Social media is bad for teenagers
2. Teenagers can't be experts in anything

If your kid tries to build an audience on Twitter, you'll realize that both of these are incorrect.

The interesting thing about Twitter is that you kind of have to be an expert–or at least very knowledgeable–on a topic if you want people to follow you.

The good news is that teenagers can totally build that expertise. Look at [Jay Yang](https://twitter.com/Jayyanginspires) or [Claudia Stellner](https://twitter.com/claudiastellner)–two teens who have expertise in an area and thousands of followers.

Which is why using Twitter can be *good* for your teenager–because it will show your them that they have what it takes to become a subject matter expert.

There are three other super important benefits to using social media:

1. Learning how to navigate the feedback process in real-time through audience reactions to their posts (If they aren’t getting likes, their strategy may need to change.)

2. Building credibility in a subject area (This is helpful both on the job hunt and in college applications, as they’ll be able to stand out from other students.)

3. Finding what actually energizes them (Writing about something on Twitter every day will probably come naturally if they enjoy their topic. If they grow tired of writing about it, or come to dread it, that’s a sign that they should move on to something else.)

Like all things in life, sometimes you have to try the wrong topic before you find the right one.

And if you're worried about your kid getting stressed by the numbers, you can always encourage them to set goals around creating and sharing content they're passionate about, rather than reaching a certain follower count.

If your kid wants to start building their audience and credibility, here are four steps they can take:

1. **Pick an energizing topic**

Picking an energizing topic is important because it will help your child to stay engaged and motivated in the long term. (Check out the difference between passion and energizing in [this newsletter.](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-31-how-to-constructively))

This could be a topic they already have knowledge in, or something that they have always wanted to learn more about. By focusing on something that energizes them, your child will be more likely to put in the effort and time needed to build their audience and credibility.

2. **Start becoming an expert**

To provide valuable insights and information to their audience, your kid will need to become a subject matter expert.

This process could involve reading books or articles, researching online, or even taking courses or attending workshops to gain more knowledge. By developing a deep understanding of their chosen topic, your teen will be able to create content that is engaging and useful.

3. **Post consistently**

The best way to gain followers and credibility is to post consistently. Consistent posting allows your kid to:

* Get in front of more people
* Increase their chances of going viral
* Become a consistent resource for their audience

Plus, consistent content creation will require your kid to continue becoming an expert in their field - which over time creates a virtuous cycle of learning and creation.

4. **Reach out to experts**

Having your kid reach out to experts and other creators writing about similar topics is another important step in building their audience and credibility.

By connecting with others who are interested in the same topic, your child can learn from their expertise, and expand their network within their field.

Plus, those experts might share their work–which is one of the best sources of credibility of all.

And, of course, they'll learn how to write cold emails, just like me :)

### Scholar’s Sources: My Favorite Resources For Writing Online

If you want to help your kid start writing online and posting on Twitter, here are a few sources that I found insanely valuable:

[This absolutely mammoth long-form essay by David Perell](https://perell.com/essay/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online/) covers everything anyone needs to know to write online. This is definitely a long read, but is totally worth it. (Also, read to the end to see an Austin Scholar cameo :) )

[Tweet Hunter](https://tweethunter.io/) is easily one of the most helpful tools to use when writing on Twitter. It can schedule tweets and automatically retweet them, can provide AI-generated tweets and thread ideas, and can display important analytics that show what threads perform the best.

[This is an incredible article](https://enzircle.com/introduction-to-personal-content-curation) on personal content curation, which involves organizing and sharing online content in a meaningful way for an individual audience. The article explains that personal content curation can help individuals tackle information overload, build knowledge, and develop their tastes. It offers suggestions for how to get started with personal content curation, including identifying topics of interest, setting up a curation system, and sharing curated content with others.

Now for some self-promo, I also wrote an article on compression and curation if you want to check it out: [The Science of Compression & How It Can Help Your Kid Go Viral.](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-24-the-science-of)

Finally, I work at [Write of Passage: Liftoff](https://liftoff.school/), which is an online program for high school students to learn how to write online. We’re starting a new cohort for the new year, so make sure you check it out.
