### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I got a 1600 SAT score
2. How your kid can, too
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been reading…

It’s Stanford decision week!! I should also be finding out about UCL (one of my other top choices) within the next few weeks. I’ll have lots of updates soon, so make sure to stay tuned.

As a whole, I’ve had a pretty high-stress few days. I’ve literally woken up at 3 am multiple days in a row because of my anxiety – which never happens. But I’m just taking deep breaths and practicing some [DBT radical acceptance](https://hopeway.org/blog/radical-acceptance) to stay calm and continue to do great work.

Parents: if any of your kids are in the midst of college applications, please give them support and grace these next few weeks :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I got a 1600 SAT score

On the topic of college applications, one pretty iconic part of mine was my 1600 SAT score.

I’d love to break down my journey to get that score, which will (hopefully) give you and your kid some tips on how to crush the exam.

Similar to the [PSAT](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-37-what-your-kid-needs), I started studying one week before the test. This might seem like I procrastinated working on the SAT, but I promise, I didn’t. All of the work and mastery that I’ve done through my [2 Hour Learning](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-82-2-hour-learning) journey has completely prepared me for succeeding. In some ways, my SAT studying started back in fourth grade when I began using online apps to master academic content.

But anyway, one week before the official test, I took two practice SAT exams. I then worked through every problem that I got wrong – and flagged any questions that I hesitated on while solving, and worked through those as well. Even if I just misread a question, I added that concept to my "to study" list. Because: mastery doesn't mean that you can get a question right. It means that you can't get it wrong.

From those questions, I tried to identify patterns in the topics that were tripping me up. For example, I realized that most of the math questions that took me a long time to solve were related to the roots of quadratic equations. Once I’d identified a pattern, I was able to look up “hacks” for those types of problems and wrote down the formulas (ex: sum of roots = -b/a and product of roots = c/a). That’s the thing about the SAT – it uses big words, but the solutions are simple.

I then created a little study guide of all of the things I needed to learn before the exam and carried it around with me everywhere.

Yes, everywhere.

So, whenever I had a spare moment (whether I was waiting in the Target bathroom line or going up an elevator), I would just pull out my folded study guides and go over the topics. [Spaced repetition](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-42-how-a-jeopardy) really does work.

As it came closer to the actual test date, I broke the test down by section and practiced the ones that were really challenging for me (like Writing & Language and the Math Calculator) a bunch of times.

And, if there were any final topics that I still struggled with after all of this studying, I would create [mnemonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic).

[Mnemonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) are phrases, acronyms, or other systems that help you remember specific concepts.

While I was doing Calculus, I could never remember which direction the second derivative parabolas faced. So, I found this catchy phrase to help me remember: up like a cup, down like a frown.

When combined with an image of smiles and frowns, I was able to ace all concavity questions.

Now, the night before the exam, I had a little checklist to go through:

* Watch overall SAT review videos to re-familiarize myself with every concept
* Go to sleep EARLY
* Review my study guide
* Get my bag (with my pencils, calculator, snack, water bottle, ID, and entrance card) ready

Super simple. I didn’t want to overwhelm myself.

And the morning of, on the drive to the testing center, I did *a lot* of square breathing (in four, hold four, out four, hold four) and did some planning for the worst.

Basically, I asked myself *what is the very worst thing that could happen if I don’t crush this exam?*

Well, I just won’t get a good SAT score.

Then, I asked myself *how would I go about fixing that?*

And the answer is very simple: take another test.

I took two SAT tests – neither of which was at my target score – before I finally crushed the third. There’s always the option to take another test, so make sure your kid knows that they’ll be okay.

### How your kid can, too

If you want your kid to get a 1500+ SAT score, don’t tell them to learn Calculus. Tell them to master 8th-grade math.

The SAT isn’t designed to gauge your high-level mathematics and writing mechanics skills. Really, it’s testing how well students understand the basics and how they can apply those concepts to a variety of problems. If your kid can find the slope, read a graph, solve for x, and understand percentages in their sleep, they’ll do better on the SAT than a kid who vaguely knows how to do those things but can also vaguely solve a matrix.

Here I’ve attached some of the notes I took for the math sections:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XaF7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91b9b204-4896-4663-a391-4731a02c8361_1318x1600.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XaF7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91b9b204-4896-4663-a391-4731a02c8361_1318x1600.jpeg)[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5q06!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F183525d1-a430-4653-b3d4-ef448e406812_1600x680.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5q06!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F183525d1-a430-4653-b3d4-ef448e406812_1600x680.jpeg)

*I know my handwriting could be hard to read, so if you or your child have any questions about the content in these notes, please reach out to me on [Twitter DMs](https://twitter.com/AustinScholar).*

If you really, really cannot figure out the answer, pick the answer choice that looks most like the others.

If your answers are 6, -6, 5, and 7.4, pick 6. It’s a 6, which matches -6; positive, which matches 5 and 7.4; and a single digit number, which matches -6 and 5.

This strategy doesn’t always work, so don’t rely on it, but you can use it as a last resort.

For the writing and language section, a lot of it is just practice and repetition, but I’ve attached my notes below as well:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wbdq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cb26826-a7b3-48d3-bfed-a5c7e8dae9d5_1600x1319.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wbdq!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cb26826-a7b3-48d3-bfed-a5c7e8dae9d5_1600x1319.jpeg)

And finally, for the reading section, there’s a lot of debate among testing experts on how to take reading comprehension tests.

*Should you read the questions before reading the passage? Or read the passage first? Should you skim the passage? Or annotate it?*

Obviously, different things work for different people–but in my experience, the most effective method is to spend time reading and comprehending the passage before moving on to the questions. If you truly understand the passage, it will be so much easier for you to craft your answers, and you won’t have to keep flipping back and forth.  Of course, there will always be a few “both answers could be right” questions, but most will go quickly.

And remember: if the entire answer choice is not explicitly stated in the passage, you’ve picked the wrong one. The reading test has to be objective. There has to be a correct answer. Don’t try to infer things from the passage. If it’s not stated, it’s not correct.

Here are a few more final notes from me:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qShf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a6f7cd0-785b-4eea-a907-e0d92fe387f6_1600x927.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qShf!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a6f7cd0-785b-4eea-a907-e0d92fe387f6_1600x927.jpeg)

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been reading…

1. [Shohei Ohtani’s $700 million contract](https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2023/12/10/23995331/shohei-ohtani-signs-los-angeles-dodgers-700-million-dollar-contract)

I am a *huge* Ohtani fan. I actually went to the Red Sox-Angels game on Ohtani’s birthday where they gave out pillows with Ohtani’s face on them (yes, that pillow is still on my bed). I’ve been anxiously waiting to see where Ohtani will end up, and I’ve had a great week diving into the contract details and theories about Ohtani’s Dodgers play. Super interesting sports stuff :)

2. [The Morning Brew gift guide](http://morningbrew.com/daily/r/?kid=09088aef)

As an avid Morning Brew reader and holiday gift procrastinator, this Sunday’s newsletter was super helpful. It has a ton of different price ranges and themes, so you can find a gift for anyone. (Dad – DO NOT click on that link. I don’t want to spoil your gift!!)

3. [The Amazing Race season 35](https://www.cbs.com/shows/amazing_race/)

This is such a beautifully heartwarming season of The Amazing Race. My mom and I have been watching every weekly episode together and absolutely love the final three teams. Each of the pairs shows great communication skills and compassion towards each other and I couldn’t imagine more lovely, yet very skilled, people to be a part of this season. Definitely recommend watching this with your kid. The finale was this last Thursday, so it’s ready to binge :)
