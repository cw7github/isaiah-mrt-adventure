### **Hey, y'all!**

Mary Poppins is one of my very favorite children's movies.

It also perfectly embodies how we need to educate kids.

The movie's most iconic songs encapsulate the essence of how true learning happens.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I Became an Academic Person (Because I Wasn't Born This Way)

Academics aren’t something to *love* in my family.

My sister’s declared she’s “not a math person” and has been turned off from other subjects, and my mom’s more into learning about physical and mental health than she is about history and literature.

My dad also didn’t enjoy the academic courses he took when he was growing up. He preferred learning life skills and exploring the non-traditional subjects like entrepreneurship and technology.

For everyone in my family, academics are just things you have to do. By the time I started elementary school, that mindset had rubbed off on me too..

I mean, sure, it was cool to get a science question correct. But I didn’t wake up in the morning and *want* to do some math problems or read about history.

Enjoyment and academics were two completely separate things for me. Any history class was a drag. Calculus was a jumble of letters and symbols.

But in the last few years, things started to change. I read an [incredible calculus book](https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Powers-Calculus-Language-Universe/dp/1786492946) that changed how I think about math and its relationship to the world. No longer were equations vague concepts that don’t *actually* mean anything. Instead, calculus and statistics and other math disciplines became crucially interwoven into everyday life. Math was just describing the world in the only universally recognizable way.

And this past year, I started having really engaging conversations with my parents about U.S. history and what its development can teach us about humanity. I began identifying overarching patterns through these conversations, that looked like storylines of books. I started to realize history was just a big story. Then, during my midterm, I got a *ton* of questions correct because I’d memorized every word to *Hamilton*.

The more I started to tackle my courses through this perspective of fascination, the more learning started to have a different connotation.

Math became about discovering connections and creating solutions, History became listening to a story. Working through these daunting subjects wasn’t a miserable part of my day anymore.

Learning academic concepts became… fun. I identified the captivating pieces of every subject and developed unique ways to learn and remember them.

Soon, I found myself watching calculus theory TikTok videos and reading history articles in my free time. I transformed my relationship with academics and started to see them as different lenses I can put on to make sense of the world around me. And that made learning absolutely irresistible to me.

Every kid should be able to see learning as something more than just a requirement. Academic subjects don’t have to be boring. I’ve been able to find what makes me love them, and your kid can, too.

### What Mary Poppins Can Teach Us About Education

I love Mary Poppins. I’ve watched the movie at least fifteen times and I’ve even acted in a Mary Poppins musical. For those of you who haven’t yet experienced this whimsical story, basically, a magical nanny turns two trouble-making children (Jane and Michael Banks) into kind, well-behaved wonders. ([Here’s the Wikipedia summary if you want a more in-depth plot.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Poppins_(film)))

I was having a conversation about learning with [David Perell](https://perell.com/) when I realized that Mary Poppins [practically perfectly](https://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/marypoppins/practicallyperfect.htm) embodies how we need to educate kids.

Mary Poppins breaks the learning process into three stages (and three iconic songs):

**Stage 1: A Spoonful of Sugar**

Every kid hates cleaning their room–and Jane and Michael are no different. But Mary Poppins makes the kids *want* to clean their room.

How? Look at the lines she so famously sings: “[In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L4qauTiCY4)”

Mary Poppins finds that fun by turning cleaning into an exciting game. She brings magic into something that seems boring and mundane. She gives Jane and Michael a spoonful of sugar to get them to want to drink the medicine of cleaning their room.

This is exactly what teachers need to do for students. You can make any subject interesting if you tap into its innate creativity and curiosity. There’s a reason each subject was created or discovered. There’s a story, a game, or even a bit of magic that goes along with it.

Take, for example, Richard Feynman. Feynman took a tedious subject like physics and weaved stories and humor through the concepts. And every one of his students learned to love it.

Don’t just tell kids to learn something. Give it to them with a spoonful of sugar.

Make them want to learn.

**Stage 2: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious**

Mary Poppins introduced a new word to Jane and Michael: [supercalifragilisticexpialidocious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M1XC00RMA8).

Learning new words or concepts–especially ones that look like different languages–can be challenging for any kid, including the Banks kids. So, how does Mary Poppins help the kids master this challenging concept in less than five minutes?

Well, she makes it personal.

She explains this new word as how she felt after winning a race. The children might not understand this new word, yet, but they do know the feeling she describes. Making something personal can help show kids that what they’re learning really does matter.

She also teaches the kids the word in a song. The entire musical number is filled with repetition and key phrases to help Jane and Michael remember the word.

Most importantly, Mary Poppins tells the kids why they need to learn this new word. She says that, “When the cat has got your tongue there's no need for dismay. Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say.”

She gives them a specific situation in which knowing the word would help them and improve their life. If Jane and Michael are ever talking to someone and they aren’t sure what to say, they know to use that word to start a conversation.

These stories, mnemonics, and context are things that help kids actually understand challenging concepts. Take, for example, the ABC song, or PEMDAS.

We remember those things because of the way they were presented to us–through catchy melodies and memorable phrases. Incorporating these while kids are being taught will teach them how they can use these new skills on their own.

**Stage 3: Let's Go Fly a Kite**

By the end of the movie, Jane and Michael don’t need a nanny anymore. They’ve learned how to be well-behaved and find joy in the small things on their own.

Mary Poppins taught them what they needed to know so they could be successful on their own. Her work was done; they could explore and grow without her holding their hands. She’d prepared them to make their way in the world.

They knew how to put in the work and how to learn new things. They were ready to go follow their interests wherever they took them (to metaphorically “[fly their kites,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g89NxTTycxc)” which is what they go and do in the (very symbolic) final scene of the movie).

This should be the goal of the education system. Education should help kids discover how to learn new things and follow their curiosities–and equip them with the skills and tools they need to do so.

Which is what the final song in the movie is all about.

For a children’s movie, Mary Poppins is full of an awful lot of insight.
