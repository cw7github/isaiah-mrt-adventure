### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: Lessons learned in my first quarter at Stanford
2. Why your kid loves Heimler’s History videos (& how to recreate them)
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

And now, ladies and gentlemen, my first quarter at Stanford is complete!! I head back home on Wednesday after my Calculus final on Tuesday, but classes are officially over.

Although I’m super excited to take some down time and spend time with my family and friends, I am pretty sad to be leaving campus for three whole weeks. My roommate and I are already planning FaceTimes to meet each other’s friends and keep each other updated. I feel like I’ve had, overall, a successful first quarter in college, so I thought I’d hold space in this newsletter to write about the lessons I’ve learned in my first quarter at Stanford. I've also been digging deep into the learning science work of David Ausubel, which is the topic of this week's article, so just keep in mind that the anecdote and article aren’t connected this week :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: Lessons learned in my first quarter at Stanford

1. Smile

The most important thing that I do every single day is smile. I smile at my roommate, my friends, the people I see in the dining hall. I smile at myself, even when I’m not feeling happy.

I’ve learned that if you’re happy, optimistic, and enjoyable to be around, you will attract all of the best people. Despite my social anxiety and general introverted-ness, my charisma levels skyrocket when I introduce myself and converse with a smile on my face.

And if you smile to yourself, you can remind yourself of all of the good things in your life. When I’m homesick, when I feel alone, when I feel like I’m aimless, when I’m worried I’m going to fail – smiling to myself puts into perspective how lucky I am, and how grateful I should be. It’s completely okay to feel angry, sad, lost, or anxious, but sitting in those feelings doesn't do anything for you. Cry, scream into a pillow, let it all out, but then put on a smile and start problem solving (even if all you solve for is how to have radical acceptance of the situation).

2. Do schoolwork during the day

The best thing I took from Alpha was the 2 Hour Learning mindset. I’ve been able to complete all of my academic school work in the morning for eight years and I don’t want to stop now.

Although I now take the full day to finish schoolwork because I have to go to this weird thing called class, I have full belief in my ability to master content without pulling all-nighters.

I know how to lock in during the day to maximize my learning and productivity and ensure that I don’t have to stay up late writing a paper or finishing a p-set.

I choose to work alone during the day and have “social time” at night – whereas a lot of my friends aren’t used to that. They operate under a “school and social time is from 9-4, then I do homework and extra stuff at night” mindset that high school trained them on. This, unfortunately, leads to becoming extremely sleep deprived and more frustrated with the workload.

Learn to get your work done during the day and you’ll be so much happier.

3. Do small things lighten your cognitive load

I never understood the whole “Steve Jobs wore the same thing every day so he had one less decision to make.”

But I’m sorry to say that, unfortunately, I’m beginning to realize he may have had a point.

Now, I don’t wear the same thing every day, but I never pick out my outfit in the morning. I do small tasks like packing my bag, laying out my outfit, and doing my hair before I go to bed at night, when I don’t need to have complex thoughts. I don’t want to have a million smaller to-dos taking up brain space in the morning before I head to my math lecture – that entire cognitive load should be reserved for learning.

I’m so much more productive and clear-minded when I don’t have small, menial tasks to worry about and can have my full brain power focused on learning.

### Why your kid loves Heimler’s History videos (& how to recreate them)

This week, I read scientist David Ausubel's 1968 article on meaningful Learning. It talked about the patterns and logic of how we learn. If you know me, you know I love [patterns and logic](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/math-is-an-art-writing-is-a-science), so of course I became immediately obsessed.

In the essay, Ausubel explains that your existing knowledge can be thought of as schemas in your long-term memory. A "schema" is a package of logic or knowledge that helps you understand how part of the world works. Each schema has "branches" or "hooks" that related knowledge can hang on.

The value of understanding schemas is that you can then use "organizers" – clear and strategic ways of presenting new information – to help students organize incoming ideas. Organizers deliberately help students find or create the correct "hooks" in an existing schema that knowledge can hang on.

The idea is that when you’re learning new material, it’s easier to learn if you just hang it on an existing schema instead of creating an entirely new one. It also highlights the interconnected aspect of education and that learning is a continuous process, not a discrete one.

I like to visualize the schema as a tree diagram, like this:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UZOv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f196e5-3752-4c72-b16b-0f2e182f8834_714x280.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UZOv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f196e5-3752-4c72-b16b-0f2e182f8834_714x280.png)

Then, the different organizers can help you figure out how to add new information onto the diagram (basically where new information connects).

There are four types of organizers:

1. [Expository](https://3starlearningexperiences.wordpress.com/2019/05/21/what-we-already-know-determines-what-how-and-how-well-we-learn/): “provides descriptions of new knowledge that learners will need to understand what follows and is often used when the new learning material is relatively unknown to the learner by relating the new information to what is already known” (read a summary before starting)
2. [Narrative](https://3starlearningexperiences.wordpress.com/2019/05/21/what-we-already-know-determines-what-how-and-how-well-we-learn/): “presents new information in a story format to the learners to activate background knowledge so that learners can make connections to what they know, often creating a personal connection to inspire learning” (tell yourself a story)
3. [Skimming](https://3starlearningexperiences.wordpress.com/2019/05/21/what-we-already-know-determines-what-how-and-how-well-we-learn/): “gives a helicopter overview of the new learning material, focusing on and noting what stands out in the new material such as headings, subheadings, and highlighted information” (use Sparknotes)
4. [Graphic](https://3starlearningexperiences.wordpress.com/2019/05/21/what-we-already-know-determines-what-how-and-how-well-we-learn/): “includes different types of visuals such as concept maps, pictographs, Venn diagrams, and so forth” (look at pictures and graphics)

A perfect example of these organizers can be found in every AP history kids’ holy grail: Heimler’s History videos.

Heimler uses all four of the different types of organizers to help “hook” new knowledge onto the branches of existing schemas.

He starts his videos with an overview of the new learning material and a quick description of this material. Then, throughout the video, he explains the historical events and concepts like a story, while also including the occasional visual aid to emphasize a concept.

Through these organizers, Heimler shows both how the information can fit into students’ existing knowledge (ex. of historical events, important people, or time periods) and how that information connects across core themes. Heimler organizes the information in a way that encourages the connection of new information with prior information that he’s talked about in previous videos.

It’s these characteristics (along with his general charisma and connection with the students) that allow Heimler’s History to continuously ensure success in students’ history learning.

Now, if you want to help your kid use this idea of schemas and organizers in their day-to-day educational life, here are a few things you can do:

1. Practice making knowledge graphs

To first understand how the basic knowledge schemas work (and therefore learn how to best utilize them), the first step is to practice creating a few.

Start by coming up with a core topic that you want to explain (ex. components of an essay), then identify the subtopics (ex. introduction, body paragraphs, conclusion), and finally break down that subtopic into smaller parts (ex. hook and thesis, topic sentence and evidence, summary and impact).

You should end up with something like this:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0kjU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F291cdba1-ef34-4c22-b392-f74ff3440969_1024x499.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0kjU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F291cdba1-ef34-4c22-b392-f74ff3440969_1024x499.png)

If you want to make a more advanced graph, check out [this website](https://neo4j.com/blog/what-is-knowledge-graph/), where it explains how to show relationships and deeper connections between topics.

2. Tell yourself stories

To tackle Ausubel’s narrative organizer, practice coming up with stories to explain concepts to yourself.

This idea is likely easiest used in history and English classes, where you can directly fit new knowledge into a story about a time period or plot, but can also work in the science-y subjects if you’re creative enough (ex. a story explaining cell division with different character names as the different phases).

3. Use the skill of dual coding

Ausubel’s ideas are super connected to the idea of dual coding: presenting information in two different formats (usually visual and auditory).

To test this out, try looking at a graph or organizer while simultaneously listening to new information. This could work especially well for more science-based concepts (like force diagrams in physics or the rock cycle), where there are easily accessible visual representations of concepts that you could analyze while listening to a lecture video on YouTube.

As a whole, I’ve loved learning about Ausubel’s work and particularly enjoy the fact that his ideas fit nicely into my belief that patterns, equations, and structures can be used to explain even the most abstract of concepts.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [David Foster Wallace’s “This is Water”](https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/)

The final COLLEGE 101 assignment for this quarter was to watch David Foster Wallace’s speech called “This is Water.”

In his speech, Wallace emphasizes *awareness*, uncertainties, and the fact that “the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about.”

I don’t believe I can do Wallace’s words justice with a simple summary, so here are my favorite quotes:

“The exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people’s two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience.”

“The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties.”

“If you’re automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won’t consider possibilities that aren’t annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options.”

“The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing.”

“It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time”

2. [Why you should learn math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaWGGHgGBWw)

In the midst of my furious studying for my Calculus final (and angrily glaring at my lecture notes that say “Not sure why this is the answer. Prof. did not explain. She said figuring this out should be a ‘fun’ exercise to do outside of class.”), I feel as though I lost sight of why I love math. So, I looked up Steven Strogatz (the author of my favorite book, *Infinite Powers*) on YouTube and found this incredible (and short – I don’t have time for long lectures) video of him explaining why math is so powerful and fascinating.

My summary: approach math like you’re a little kid trying to put together a puzzle – with wonder, persistence, and laughter. Math is all about patterns, you just have to figure out how the pieces fit together.

And as I am a Stanford student, I must say to please ignore the Cornell ad at the end of the video – my favorite mathematician has to have a few flaws, I suppose.

3. [Innocents Abroad by Mark Twain](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3176/3176-h/3176-h.htm)

This is a pretty long piece, so I’m definitely not recommending that you read this, but *Innocents Abroad* was one of my favorite pieces of Twain’s I read in my “Mark Twain and American Culture” class. The overall vibe of this piece is essentially Twain telling his readers to learn how to think critically – to not accept the things they’re told at face value. Twain takes down the European tour guides who go to lengths to scam tourists out of their money and pretend they are more knowledgeable than they really are. One of my favorite lines is in Chapter 17, when Twain says that, “[w]e find a piece of the true cross in every old church we go into, and some of the nails that held it together…Then there is the crown of thorns; they have part of one in Sainte Chapelle, in Paris, and part of one, also, in Notre Dame. And as for bones of St. Denis, I feel certain we have seen enough of them to duplicate him, if necessary.” There is so much fake news, with so many tour guides showing us more bones of St. Denis than we know what to do with, that this message is truly more important than ever.
