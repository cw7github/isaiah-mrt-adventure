### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. What two weeks in Asia taught me about independence
2. Scholar’s Sources: Trip highlights

I’m back!! After two incredible weeks gallivanting across Asia with four of my closest friends, it’s time to get back to it.

We spent a week in Japan (Tokyo and Kyoto), three days in Singapore, and five days in the UAE (Dubai and Abu Dhabi). I’m truly blessed to have been able to have such an incredible trip (and grateful to my parents for making sure I did absolutely no work on the trip – it’s probably the last time in my life I’ll be as obligation-free as I am now).

College feels like it’s getting closer and closer, so I’m really going to start preparing for that. I also missed my family so much over just two weeks, so I can’t imagine how hard college is going to be. If you have any tips for transitioning to living far away from your family, please let me know.

### What two weeks in Asia taught me about independence

Now, some of you might be thinking, what could you have possibly learned about independence that you didn’t last year in Ukraine creating an education program for refugees? That sounds a lot harder than a senior trip with your friends.

Well, I have to admit, navigating around a ton of cities in Asia and creating plans and activities for each day is a lot different than being holed up in an AirBnB and a school working on an event. Probably not harder, but definitely different. And I learned *a lot*.

1. Flexibility

I love plans.

I’m a super meticulous person with to-do lists and schedules scribbled in any notebook I can find.

This trip, I really learned that not everyone is like me. Some people feel totally comfortable – and even enjoy – going into days with things not scheduled, planned, or booked. On one morning when no one had made plans, I was terribly stressed and anxious – I had no idea what was going on. If we weren’t deliberate about our day, were we even going to get to do the things we’d wanted to do in the city?

This anxiety was putting me in a bad mood and tainting what could’ve been an incredible morning. I kept thinking to myself, *I’m on a once-in-a-lifetime trip with my friends, and I’m stressed that things aren’t perfectly planned? I can’t let my stress ruin this.*

I practiced taking deep breaths and recognized that the world wasn’t going to end because we didn’t get everything done on our to-do list for that day – or worse, if we didn’t have a to-do list at all.

I put a smile on my face and told myself to let go of that stress and enjoy the day ahead.

And I did.

This day was a *huge* growth moment for me – letting go of control and plans and simply enjoying life.

2. Learning how to say no

Despite our similar educational experiences, my friends and I could not be more different. We have almost opposite interests – and sometimes, we just want to have different experiences in life.

While I love them endlessly and know they’ll have a huge impact on my life forever, it can make some parts of vacationing together… challenging.

They’ll want to go out and experience life in a way that just doesn’t resonate with me – and that’s okay.

But on our trip, I didn’t have any excuses. No parents to call to make up a task for me to do at home, no sister who needed me to pick her up. I was in complete control over the situation. I had to stand my ground and tell my friends that I was just going to go back to the hotel and to text me when they were heading home.

As someone with immense anxiety, that was really hard for me to do. I didn’t want them to think I was lame or get annoyed with me bailing, but when I thought about it, I knew that these people would always support me, just as I would them.

I could tell them “no” and wake up in the morning still secure in our friendships.

But now, since I’ve practiced it, I feel ten times more comfortable saying “no” in other situations – with people I might not be as comfortable with.

3. Looking at situations positively

As I mentioned, my friends and I don’t always have aligned interests. Something they particularly enjoy is shopping. I, unfortunately, don’t share that interest as strongly as they do. When we were walking down the shopping district in Kyoto and finding customizable chopsticks and rings and antique stores, I was all-in – it was an experience I couldn’t get anywhere else in the world. But when we walked into the fourth Zara of the trip, I started to get annoyed.

I felt like I was wasting time in incredible cities in stores we could go to in the US.

But my friends all really enjoyed trying on dresses and seeing what new things they could find that weren’t in US stores.

So while they were there, instead of staying annoyed and angrily thinking about what else we could be doing, I paused and started to think positive thoughts about the situation:

We’re in a mall in Singapore. We happen to be in a Zara. There are other stores. These other stores are probably cool. I should go walk around. That would be fun.

Negativity often blinds me to obvious solutions – I get so caught up in what’s wrong I can’t think about what would fix it. Being in a place where I wanted to find the positive in everything was great practice to – hopefully – get better at being solution-focused.

4. My family will always be there, no matter how far away I am

Throughout this entire trip, I knew my family was always a text or phone call away. I probably annoyed them with the constant photos and texts updating them on what I was doing *at that very moment*, but they always responded with a heart or an exclamation. I didn’t feel so alone and far away – they always answered my calls, and talked to me for as long as I needed, which made me feel so supported and loved.

So yes, I’m terrified for college. I’m terrified of being so far away from them and of being completely independent for the first time.

But I know my family will be there to support me every step of the way.

### Scholar’s Sources: Trip highlights

I thought I’d take this space to write about my favorite places we went to and the coolest things we experienced.

Japan:

* [The Meiji Shrine](https://www.meijijingu.or.jp/en/)

The very first thing we did in Japan was visit the Meiji Shrine and it was the best possible introduction to Japan we could’ve imagined. The shrine stood grand, intricate, and beautiful – you could feel the power and respect pouring out from every corner of the structure. Truly a sight to behold. (I also purchased a “safe driving” amulet for my sister, so that should help her out.)

* [Omoide Yokocho street](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g14133673-d1173749-Reviews-Omoide_Yokocho-Nishishinjuku_Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html)

This street is filled with food stalls with kabobs, kobe beef, and different noodles. It’s such a sensory overload when you walk in, but that’s what makes it awesome. Everywhere you look, there’s something cool and new to try.

* [Aoyama Flower Market](https://foreign.aoyamaflowermarket.com/foreign/teahouse/pc/)

The Flower Market was my favorite cafe we went to during the entire trip. You’re basically just having tea and french toast while surrounded by flowers. Beautiful.

* Everything in Kyoto

My favorite place we went to has to be Kyoto. It’s hard to explain, but being in Kyoto kind of feels like you’re being let in on a secret – like you’re finding places that no one’s been before. Of course, Kyoto is a very big and popular city, so that’s not true, but the feeling is magic.

Singapore:

* [Gardens by the Bay](https://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/)

The gardens were truly remarkable displays of nature and architecture combined – thousands and thousands and thousands of plants, formed into beautiful structures and experiences. I felt as though I was in a different world entirely.

* [The Marina Bay Sands hotel pool](https://www.marinabaysands.com/)

The pool not only was the perfect temperature, but also gave us the perfect vantage point to look at the entire city.

* [Newton Food Centre](https://newtonfoodcentre.com/)

My favorite meal of the whole trip (not just Singapore) had to be the Newton Food Centre. I had Michelin-star chicken and beef skewers and prawns in cereal, along with great noodles, dumplings, and fried rice. Incredible dinner.

The UAE:

* [Traditional desert safari](https://www.platinum-heritage.com/heritage-desert-safari/)

This was another one of my favorite experiences – we learned a *ton* about the UAE (their national sport is camel racing with robots?!) and watched their national animal, oryx, run with gazelles and near falcons and owls. We had a traditional Middle Eastern meal and did a star gazing activity to close out the night. Truly magical.

* [Ferrari World](https://www.ferrariworldabudhabi.com/)

No one does theme parks like the UAE – and Ferrari World sets records like nowhere else. The entire park is inside and a lot of it feels as though you’re walking the streets of Italy. My favorite ride is Flying Aces – the steepest steel roller coaster with the biggest loop in the world. Such a fun experience.

* [Butterfly Garden](https://www.dubaibutterflygarden.com/)

If you want to fulfill your childhood dreams and become a fairy, the Dubai Butterfly Garden is the place to go. Thousands of butterflies flutter around you, and, if you’re lucky, a few may even land on you.

* [Dinner at the Burj Khalifa](https://www.burjkhalifa.ae/en/)

There’s nothing more iconic than the Burj Khalifa in regards to Dubai. You feel on top of the world – and your problems don’t seem that big. Your perspective is bound to change after visiting the Burj Khalifa.
