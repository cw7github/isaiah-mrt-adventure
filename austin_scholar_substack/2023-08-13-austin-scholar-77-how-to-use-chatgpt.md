### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: Setting my senior year goals
2. How to use ChatGPT to break through goal paralysis
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been reading this week

I’ve had a very busy week of doing absolutely nothing. Since it’s my last week of summer, I have been soaking up the sun in my living room while watching some awesome TV shows: Monk (intense detective show), Lie to Me (intense detective show), Gotham (intense detective show), and, of course, The Kardashians (trashy reality show). This is the last week of rest, though, so get ready for many more updates soon.

### Austin’s Anecdote: Setting my senior year goals

As my summer comes to a close and the school year approaches, I’ve started to really think about what I want to accomplish in my senior year. (Wow–saying “senior year” is never going to get any less weird.) This is my last hurrah at Alpha–and my last chance to show how I’ve grown in the last eight years since I left traditional school.

There’s so much I have to balance: college applications and preparations, growing [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/AustinScholar) and Substack audiences, finishing my academic courses, following the Alpha life skills curriculum, and spending as much time as I can with the people I love before I leave. I have so much going through my head, and so much nervous energy coursing through my body, that it’s really hard to think clearly about my goals.

On that note, it’s always kind of scary to set my yearly goals because there are so many unknowns: am I going to be good at this academic class? will I still have the same friends? what if I join a club? what if I fail at something? what if it all falls apart and I fail all of my classes and have no friends and have to repeat a year and then can’t graduate?

With so little life experience, it’s so easy to catastrophize and become intimidated by the length of a year, and how much can change in that time.

Plus, so much about school depends on extrinsic motivation. Basically every kid only goes to school because they’re forced to, not because they want to. (I know this is true for me.) Honestly, everything even school-adjacent is only done because kids want to get into a good college, which they see as being necessary for a better life.

This leads to kids just doing the things they're "supposed" to do, without ever stopping to think about what they actually want. So, how do we fix this? Well, it all starts with helping kids set goals that *they truly value*.

### How to use ChatGPT to break through goal paralysis

Setting valuable yearly goals can seem basically impossible. It's hard to think about what's useful, or what's attainable, or what's actually exciting to you, not just what your parents or teachers or college admissions boards want you to work on.

If your kid is paralyzed by goal setting for this year, ChatGPT might be able to help. I used it for setting my goals this year, and it helped me get clearer on my goals than I've ever been (even with senior year overwhelm).

It's so much easier for us as teens to answer questions about what we want when they come from a computer, not from someone whose opinion we care a lot about. And because ChatGPT can give me really nuanced questions, it helps me become nuanced about my own goals.

So, here’s how you and your kid can use ChatGPT to set goals they’ll actually want to accomplish:

The first step is to give ChatGPT a bit of background on who you are and what you want to do.

Use this prompt: State your age, what grade you’re going into, what classes you’ve already taken, what classes you are taking this year, any projects you’re working on or have done, your hobbies, and some vague future goals (like going to an Ivy League college, becoming a D1 athlete, making a million dollars from a business, etc.).

Then say: I am a motivated student willing to work hard to accomplish my goals. However, I am trying to create my goals for this year, but I don’t know where to start and what I actually value. I don’t want to set goals to do things because I feel like I should be doing them. Please ask me 10 questions to help discover what parts of my life I value most and what I genuinely want to spend time working on this year. Make sure to ask about academics, life skills and experiences, and personal things.

Answer each question ChatGPT asks directly in the chat box. Then, ask ChatGPT what themes seem to be consistently appearing in your answers, and ask it to come up with challenging yearly goals that encompass those themes.

Use this prompt: What themes have consistently appeared in my answers? Create three categories: academics, extracurriculars, and personal. Then, come up with five examples of challenging, extremely impressive goals in each category that I would be proud of accomplishing. Remember, I’m a [] grader, so factor those requirements into the goals as well.

Last, finalize your goals and ask ChatGPT to come up with a plan (daily, weekly, monthly–whatever you want) to help you achieve these goals.

Use this prompt: Here are my yearly goals. Now, come up with a daily and weekly “task list” I can follow to achieve these goals. Be extremely detailed and include how long each task will take.

That’s all the theory behind it, but let me show you how it has worked for me:

And that’s it! I seriously feel so much better about my goals since I’m working towards the things I genuinely value. I now even have a daily task list and am ready to crush the year.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been reading this week

1. [The nuances behind being an introvert](https://twitter.com/moshe3t/status/1689853706068496385?s=20)

I consider myself a pretty strong introvert and love curling up in my bed with a good book to recharge. But I totally feel fired up when I’m talking about my newsletter, education, or any one of my favorite trashy reality TV shows. I hadn’t recognized this distinction until I read this tweet and I feel like it’s a super important part of learning to handle social situations.

2. [David Perell’s Friday Finds](https://perell.com/newsletter/)

I love reading Friday Finds each week, but I particularly enjoyed the discussion of *The Prince* and Machiavelli’s love of reading. Also, I felt super motivated by the end of David’s explanation of why traveling is so powerful. As he says: Get out and Do the Thing because certain kinds of knowledge can only be gained through tactile, first-hand experience.

3. [Ana Lorena Fabrega and experiencing confusion](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1689671447130849280?s=20)

I loved this tweet and graphic. Teaching kids low-stakes struggle is such a powerful thing and will prepare them for success later on.

**Thanks for reading. Go crush the week! See y'all on Sunday.**
