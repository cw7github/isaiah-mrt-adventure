### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: Stanford admit weekend
2. How to become your kid’s support system
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

Stanford Admitted Students weekend was last weekend!! You’ll hear more details in the anecdote, but overall it was such an incredible experience and only made me more excited about going to college. I stayed in the actual dorms for two nights with current freshmen – and it’s crazy to think that I will be just like them in a year.

Growing up is surreal.

### Austin’s Anecdote: Stanford admit weekend

So: admit weekend.

It was honestly a whirlwind. I met so many new, incredible people who have done such impressive things. There were kids there who invented new colors, had organizations in over 15 countries, and won national title after national title. I had a little imposter syndrome, but mostly felt awe towards the people I’ll get to spend my next four years with.

We had three full days of attending example masterclasses (my favorite was a mathematical magic show), going to different seminars and events about life at Stanford (I loved going to the activities fair – definitely joining the ice skating club), watching showcases (dance, a cappella, and band performances), eating good food (supposedly they made better food than usual for the weekend…), and walking (I literally walked 20,000 steps each day).

And on top of that, I had hundreds of conversations with different people and met more new people in one weekend than I have in my life.

One of my favorite parts of the weekend, though, was ringing the “committed students” gong. At the very end of the weekend, all of the students who had committed to Stanford stood in line to ring a gong and scream the following dialogue:

Current Stanford student: “What’s your name?”

Me: “Austin Scholar!!!”

Current Stanford student: “Where are you from?”

Me: “Austin, TX!!!”

Current Stanford student: “And where are you going to school next year?”

Me: “STANFORD!!!”

So fun and exhilarating.

We got back to Austin on Saturday, and on Sunday I had a family reunion in Victoria, Texas.

The event itself was totally fun – I love visiting my Mimi and Grandad, and my aunts, uncles, and cousins – but after Admit Weekend, I felt completely overwhelmed.

There was so much going on in my brain and on the drive back, I couldn’t get my hands to stop shaking.

And that night, as I tried to go to sleep, everything kind of came together and I had a pretty bad panic attack. But after the worst of that was over, I found my dad in the living room and curled up next to him while I finished calming down.

And once I stopped crying, he started distracting me by asking me what my thoughts were on *God Emperor of Dune* – and I fell down a rabbit hole talking about how annoying Duncan Idaho became, how awesome Leto II II (the second Leto II) is, and how the kind-of protagonist of this book (Siona) reminds me of the movie version of Chani.

That eventually tired me out and my dad and I came up with a plan to move forward: take a shower tonight and sleep in tomorrow until I went skating.

So I did just that and already felt better by the time I arrived at school.

But I was still so incredibly wired and could feel the anxiety and overwhelm in my chest. My AP Physics 2 practice exam was on Wednesday, so I had to focus, but I just couldn’t.

So I called my mom.

She walked me through what actions I could take to start solving my problems: do some deep breathing, change locations (go to a different room to work), and come home early.

She reminded me that I wasn’t being very productive, and unless I wanted tomorrow to be the same, I needed to take care of myself today.

As much as I’ve healed – gotten [“better” in my head](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-98-i-got-rejected) – I still have bad days. I still cry and feel the heaviness in my chest and can’t get my mind to just shut up, but I know I can go to my parents for help.

And they know how to help me.

I am so incredibly grateful both to them and to the fact that we’re able to have this relationship.

### How to become your kid’s support system

As that final sentence alluded to, my parents and I have had to work for our relationship.

Here are a few things you can do to have an awesome relationship with your own kids:

* Learn what your kid needs when they’re upset

This is by far the most important thing you can do. No two kids are the same. They all react to different situations in different ways. Some kids would rather their parents just listen to them, instead of trying to solve their problems; some kids are the opposite. Some kids might not want to talk about it at all – instead they just want a distraction. Figure out what your kid needs from you, then do that.

* Listen to all of their rants the best you can

A great way to get your kid to feel like they can come to you with their problems is by listening to all of their “not problems” first. If you’re dismissive of the smaller things, your kid might feel like you’ll be dismissive of the big things, too.

* Model to them how you deal with problems and negative emotions

Show your kid that when you are struggling with something, you go to someone to work through it. Talk to your spouse about the problem, and if it’s not too big of a burden, talk to your kids about what’s going on and ask for their help.

(Pro tip: look for how they naturally try to help you. Chances are, that’s how they would want you to help *them* in that scenario.)

* Tell them how you can help before it gets bad

When emotions are high, it’s hard for your kid to try out a new behavior that they don’t know will work. So, explain to them beforehand how you’d help them. Proactively tell them about how you’re willing to listen to anything they’re going through, help them problem solve, distract them with a TV show or discussion about a book, or just sit with them for company. You’d be surprised by how often they take you up on that.

Creating this type of relationship can take a lot of work, but it’s so worth it, I promise.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [Survivor Season 46](https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Survivor_46)

If you want to show your kid why it’s lame to be a quitter, watch this season of Survivor (or any of the “new era” seasons, 41-46). Lately, Survivor has had a problem of casting *fans* of Survivor instead of casting *players* of Survivor. These fans just want the experience of saying they were on Survivor and tend to see the physical conditions with rose-colored glasses. So when they get to the beach, when they have to start making hard decisions, they want to give up. As a viewer, it’s beyond pathetic and annoying, and this season reinforced this view for me. Whenever I think about giving up on something, I just ask myself if I’ll look as obnoxious as the “new era” Survivor players. Usually, that gets me out of my funk and I dive right back in.

2. [Advice for Stanford freshmen](https://www.unigo.com/colleges/stanford-university/what-should-every-freshman-at-your-school-know-before-they-start)

Admit Weekend showed me how close I am to leaving. Going to college. So, obviously, I’ve started doing my research and looking up advice for Stanford freshmen. The website I’ve linked above has such great information and advice for all college students, so I highly recommend it.

Some highlights: don’t waste time, don’t make academics your whole life, try new things, make a bunch of friends, and don’t doubt your abilities.

3. [Ultimate Review Packet](https://www.ultimatereviewpacket.com/collections)

For any student who needs some serious AP review before next week, use the Ultimate Review Packet. It’s saving my life in European History and I can’t recommend it enough.

Wish your kid luck from me and check out some of my [other newsletters](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-12-managing-may) on AP prep :)
