### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: Why I Care So Much About Mental Health
2. My Interview with Sadie Sutton (A Teen Mental Health Expert)
3. Scholar’s Sources: My Favorite Resources on Mental Health

Happy Easter, everyone! My little sister’s birthday was yesterday (she turned fifteen?!), so it’s already been an exciting weekend.

I’m also getting into hardcore studying mode. As AP tests keep getting closer, the time I spend taking practice tests and going through flashcards is dramatically ramping up. Wish me luck!

### Austin’s Anecdote: Why I Care So Much About Mental Health

I’ve talked a lot about my mental health journey in [previous newsletters](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-15-even-if-its-not). The short version: I’d been having trouble for a while, but the COVID lockdown hit me really hard.

I was in intensive in-patient therapy for the first half of my freshman year of high school. It was incredibly challenging. But, I came out of it stable–and actually a little bit okay.

For six months after I left therapy, I dreamed about helping thousands of kids with their own mental health and to help parents figure out what was going on in their kids' heads. But I would just feel so sad every time I worked on it, so I transitioned into education :)

That’s why I was so incredibly inspired when I found Sadie Sutton, who created the *[She Persisted](https://www.shepersistedpodcast.com/)* podcast. *She Persisted* is a mental health podcast where Sadie–who’s 19 years old–dives into every aspect of mental wellness in an authentic, accessible, relatable way.

I reached out to Sadie for an interview on my newsletter, and she was kind enough to agree. We ended up having a really interesting conversation–which had me jumping around with excitement after we were finished.

So, here’s my super awesome, insanely insightful interview with Sadie Sutton:

### My Interview with Sadie Sutton (A Teen Mental Health Expert)

**Me: Would you mind talking a bit about your story? What motivated you to create** ***She Persisted*****?**

Sadie: In eighth grade, I began struggling with low moods and had issues with sleep–common signs of depression in teenagers. I sought treatment, starting with my primary care doctor (which is a great place to begin if you need mental health support but aren’t sure where to start).

I tried various treatments, including a year and a half of intensive outpatient programs, hospital stays, inpatient programs, family therapy, and so much more. Despite all of these efforts, I still struggled with depression, anxiety, self-esteem, relationships, self-harm, and suicidal ideation.

I was lucky to attend a good, [DBT-focused](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22838-dialectical-behavior-therapy-dbt) residential program, which allowed me to turn things around. For the first time, I trusted others to help me. I invested myself in the treatment and saw the wisdom in mental health recovery.

I cultivated a tiny bit of self-compassion and had hope from knowing that we were doing an evidence-based treatment that had tons of research supporting its effectiveness for teens who were struggling with the same issues that I was.

I built the foundation for my mental health, learned coping skills and balanced medications.

Eventually, I realized that everyone who told me that I would recover–was right. It *was* possible to improve my mental health, even as a teen.

As a teen, it was important for me to share with others where I had been, as I could be living proof to them that recovery was possible. I had access to a lot of mental health resources that I wished I knew about earlier in my journey, so I started sharing my insights and skills with others through my podcast, *She Persisted*.

It's been almost four years now, and on *She Persisted*, we’ve had conversations about every aspect of mental health, including relationships, self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, and so much more.

I'm proud of the skills I learned during treatment that I still use to maintain my mental health today.

**I love your mission of letting teens know that it** ***will*** **get better. What are the thoughts and mindset that cause teens to believe–wholeheartedly–that it can’t?**

75% of mental illnesses develop by the age of 18 or 24, making adolescence a critical period for mental illness development.

Teenagers are in a vulnerable period due to hormonal and emotional changes, an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex, and ineffective problem-solving skills. Putting it all together, then, when you are predisposed to being more emotional and less rational, mental health struggles emerge.

And, as a teen, you have all of these pivotal moments–whether it's the relationships you're building, trying to decide what your passions are, deciding what you want to do for college, etc.

You're getting graded on all of these things that you're told are going to impact your future so significantly, which can be really, really challenging to navigate.

Also, teens tend to have a tendency to put more emphasis on the present than is realistic and accurate, which leads to feeling super overwhelmed.

It's so important to educate teenagers on how to handle mental health struggles effectively and for parents to work on strengthening their relationships with their children.

**How do you think that teens’ poor mental health impacts their relationship with their parents? What do you think is one next step that parents could take to help bridge that connection again?**

The generational gap can make it difficult for parents and kids to connect, especially when it comes to things like social media and communication with friends. Also, teens’ lack of autonomy can lead to a victim mentality and their lack of communication can make it harder to ask for help.

As a teenager, I struggled with the lack of autonomy that comes with that age, and ended up blaming my parents for my problems. But for me, one of the biggest game-changers is that my parents went on this journey with me. Treatment is more effective when parents are involved and learn alongside their child.

By learning the skills and reflecting on themselves, parents can create a healthier environment and improve coping with all the distress that may arise. This is a win-win situation for everyone involved.

The first step that parents can take is simple yet profound: validation. As a parent, validation can be a game changer because it's all that teens really want from their family, peers, and themselves–to feel validated and worthy, especially when dealing with challenging issues such as identity and emotions.

To have someone say, "I see you're struggling, and I'm here for you" can mean the world to a teen.

The best part about validation is that parents don't have to condone any negative behaviors that may present themselves. All they need to acknowledge is that emotion–and everything else, such as conflicts and negative behaviors–are simply manifestations of that emotion.

By dealing with the root issue and meeting that need for validation, parents can improve the relationship with their child.

For me, hearing my parents say that they saw I was in pain and struggling, and that they still loved me regardless–that meant the world.

I had believed that I was not deserving of love and that my mental health made me less lovable. But, when my parents said it was okay and it didn't impact our relationship, it completely changed my mindset.

**What is something that** ***all*** **parents can do to improve their relationship with their kids and to continuously improve their kids’ mental health?**

Treat every piece of vulnerability or conversation as if they were coming to you and saying they weren't okay. React to their feelings and appreciate their vulnerability. Reinforce that you will be accepting, validating, there for them, and love them unconditionally.

This will help them feel more comfortable going to you and being vulnerable.

It's important to have a dynamic where your children can ask for help when they need it, and you can provide it. It might take practice, but it’s worth it.

Also, it’s super important to model how you want your kid to act. Do *you* have a sense of purpose and healthy relationships? How do *you* talk to yourself and validate yourself and your family members? How do *you* approach conflict? You need to model all of these things for your kids so they can learn how to live a healthy life themselves.
