This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Where we are now: How my relationship with my parents has improved
2. Answering FAQs about teen mental health
3. A letter to the teens

Because today is the first of June, this is the last newsletter in the Mental Health Awareness Month series. In the [most recent newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-15-the-secrets-to?s=w) of this series, I talked about a lot of the struggles that my parents and I had to work through in order to improve communication with each other. In this newsletter, I will answer some FAQs about teen mental health and at the end, a letter to teenagers, so you should totally send this newsletter to your kid.

In case you missed last week’s disclaimers: I am not a therapist. I am not saying I am a therapist. I am not diagnosing your children. My hope is to draw from my own experiences and the stories of my friends to give y’all a view into the darker parts of a teenager’s mind.

In next week’s newsletter, I’ll talk about Pride Month and what that means for a lot of LGBTQ+ teenagers, so stay tuned for that.

### Austin’s Anecdote

I’m not going to lie: I used to believe that I would never be able to have a great connection with my mom. Her interests just seemed to align more with my little sister’s, not mine. They seemed to be able to talk about shopping and fashion for hours, and they are both a lot more extroverted and social than I am.

I could just never seem to create that relationship with my mom that I saw in Gilmore Girls.

When we would do things together, I seemed to always find a way to complain about them. For example, my mom and I are a part of [NCL](https://www.nationalcharityleague.org/), a mother-daughter volunteer organization. Unfortunately, one part of NCL is group meetings with other teenagers who are in my age group. I *hated* these meetings. With a passion. All the other girls went to the local high school and knew each other, but I went to Alpha, so I always felt awkward and ended up standing to the side.

I really did not like these group things and would complain for hours before and after each meeting. My mom would sit in the car and listen as I ranted and told her that I wanted to quit NCL, if only to escape these stupid meetings.

A couple of years in (yes– this went on for years. Mom, I’m so sorry.), it was my sister’s turn to go to an NCL meeting.

And *wow*, my perspective completely changed.

As I listened to my mom and sister argue about NCL, I realized that all my mom wanted was to find some way to spend time with us. And my sister and I just spent the entire time complaining.

It was eye-opening for me, and I realized that if I wanted my relationship with my mom to improve, I had to take steps to work on myself (and my complaining).

After witnessing The NCL Argument for myself, while I wasn’t perfect, I tried my best to stop complaining about the meetings and instead focus on the time I was spending with my mom. And on the days where there were particularly… frustrating meetings, I would complain *with* her, not *at her*.

And while I was working on my criticism, my mom began to talk to me about my own interests and tried her best to converse about baseball and Marvel with me.

Now, I can confidently say that my mom is one of my best friends, and we pride ourselves on being the only responsible people in our apartment.

On to my dad!

I don’t know if you could tell from my previous newsletters, but my dad and I have always had a pretty… interesting relationship. I wanted to be just like him and I spent every day trying to impress him and make sure that he would be proud of me.

While I logically knew that he loved me no matter what, he wasn’t always the best at showing it.

For years, I had put my self-worth into what my dad thought of me, and exhausted myself trying to make myself “good enough” for him to love me.

Our relationship had pretty much been doomed for a while. I’d come up with a mile-long list of impossible achievements that I believed I needed to accomplish for my dad to be proud of me.

For our relationship to begin to improve, I’ve had to work on my self-esteem and make sure that I feel good about myself because of *me*, not my dad.

Once I was able to do that, I wrote my dad a letter (writing is easier for me than talking) explaining to him how I’d been feeling.

I immediately noticed a difference. He started making sure to tell me at least once a day that he loved me and was proud of me. Even when he didn’t, I stopped spiraling into an “I’m not good enough” loop.

Two years ago, I thought it would be impossible for me to ever have a good relationship with my parents.

Look at me now.

I’m so proud of the work that both my parents and I have done to improve our relationship.

### Answering Mental Health FAQs

Here are five questions that I received from parents about teen mental health and in this section, I will provide my answers to these FAQs.

1. Will exposing my kid to all these mental health resources just make them more prone to mental health issues?

Short answer: no. Because of social media and the “gen-z culture,” your teenager is going to find out about (or have an experience with) mental health issues. Whether they see an Instagram post with the caption “gonna [kms](https://www.dictionary.com/e/acronyms/kms/#:~:text=KMS%20%E2%80%94%20An%20abbreviation%20for%20%22kill,be%20particularly%20alarming%20for%20parents.)” or overhear girls in the bathroom talking about how they stopped eating dinner, learning about mental health issues is inevitable.

I believe it is crucial for teenagers to have a positive first experience with mental health. Sitting them down and giving them resources and starting the conversation in a positive manner can help their understanding of mental health come from a place of safety and love, not a stranger on Reddit.

1. How do I make sure that my kid isn’t hiding mental health issues from me?

I don’t think that you can ever be 100% certain that your kid is or isn’t hiding how they are feeling. All you can do is be there for them and let them know that you are there. Short of forcing your teen to talk to you for two hours every single day (like my own experience I shared in [Austin Scholar #15](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-15-the-secrets-to?s=w)), it’s hard to *make* your teen talk to you. Being open and non-judgemental at all times is a great way to *encourage* your teen to feel comfortable sharing how they feel.

If you start noticing [warning signs](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/depression/depression-symptoms-and-warning-signs.htm), see if your teen would be willing to talk to a professional – or at least someone who isn’t their parent.

Coming to a parent is really scary, and I always found it easier to talk to other adults because I wasn’t as worried about their reactions. Making sure that your teenager has other adults that they trust in their life can help them feel supported, loved, and more willing to go talk to an adult about what’s going on.

1. I'm trying to make myself available to really listen to my child, but they don't seem to want to talk to me. What should I do?

This can be pretty hard because forcing your teen to talk to you (as I explained in my [last newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-15-the-secrets-to?s=w)) usually ends up as a negative experience. There are two things that you can do to help:

* Let them go to other trusted adults

  + While I completely understand that it would be preferable and feel safer for your teen to go to you, as I mentioned in the previous question, it can feel really daunting for teenagers to go to their parents. Letting them go to another trusted adult (who would hopefully recommend that your teen talk to you) at least gets them talking about how they’re feeling.
* Be intentional about what you say

  + We’re teenagers. We overdramatize everything and overanalyze details. An offhand comment (for example: [the kids in China](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-15-even-if-its-not?s=w)) can discourage your teen from feeling like they can talk to you. Also, making fun of or ignoring their interests can create a narrative that you don’t care about what they like, so why would you listen to or care about anything else.

1. How can I best support my child if their friend is going through a really tough mental health issue?

I think that with this, the best thing is that you make sure that your teenager knows that they are not responsible for their friend’s feelings or actions. Leading by example and being there for your kid can also show them how to support their friend.

Also making sure that your teenager knows what resources and which people to go to can help your kid feel like they know how to help their friend. I shared a great list of these sources in [Austin Scholar #14.](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-15-even-if-its-not?s=w)

1. How can I check in on my kid's mental health without being too pushy?

Try to be vulnerable in the conversation too. For example, this past week, there was a tragedy in Uvalde. I won’t get into it, but I know that my mom was worried about how I was feeling about the whole thing. Instead of being “pushy” and asking me a bunch of questions about how I felt, she talked about how she was sad and scared. And then, in turn, I mentioned that I had been feeling worried and had read some super sad stuff on Instagram.

Because my mom opened up to me first, instead of feeling like I was getting interrogated about my feelings, I felt like I was having a conversation.

### A Letter to the Teens

A couple of years ago, I remember sitting in the doctor’s office, staring at the mandatory depression-check-sheet (I still don’t know what it’s called) and wondering if I should answer honestly. Looking back, all I can think is *damn, I would’ve been saved a lot of trouble if I just checked that box.*

Obviously, in my newsletters, I write more for parents. I’m still a teenager, though, so I get it: dealing with mental health is exhausting. It feels as though the bad stuff is never going to go away. I also understand the fear of admitting that something’s wrong. At the doctor’s office, I tried to answer the survey as though I had never been sad a day in my life. At home, I tried my best to pretend everything was fine. I suffered alone for three years.

But then I asked for help. And now, almost two years later, I cannot tell you how amazing it feels to get up in the morning and not be disappointed that I woke up. It’s not perfect, but I can finally spend my time living in the now instead of being trapped in the war inside my mind.

As cliche as it sounds, it will get better. Take a deep breath and ask for help.

You got this.
