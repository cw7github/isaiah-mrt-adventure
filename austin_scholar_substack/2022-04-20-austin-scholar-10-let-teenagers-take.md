### **Hey, y'all!**

Welcome to the Austin Scholar newsletter! To all of my new subscribers, I'm so excited and grateful that y'all are here! To all of my returning subscribers, welcome back, and thank you for the continued support.

Please forward this newsletter to other parents who want to learn ways to help make twelve years of school less painful and more fulfilling for their children.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. My experience with sleep and anxiety
2. Let teenagers take naps
3. Three sources on sleep that were fascinating to read while I researched this newsletter

The [previous newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-9-the-accounting-disaster?s=w) was all about balance (or lack thereof), and this week I found myself needing to take my own advice. I had a test every single day and found myself staying up late in order to study and prepare.

This, of course, led to me not getting very much sleep and I spent the week exhausted and lethargic. While I was writing this newsletter, I found myself daydreaming and being quite unfocused, which caused me to think that if I wrote about the importance of sleep, maybe I would be more inclined to rest instead of study :)

### Austin’s Anecdote: My experience with sleep and anxiety

I have always had a lot of trouble sleeping. (My mom can confirm–I was quite the tiring baby.) Throughout elementary school, I would wake up my babysitter at 11 o’clock because I couldn’t fall asleep. (Sorry, y’all!) In middle school, I started doing school work until midnight and reading until 1 AM. During the COVID year, I couldn’t let myself go to bed until I had finished the next day’s work. Please don’t ask me the logic behind this. Anyways, I have basically been exhausted and sleep-deprived for my entire life.

The main reason I could never fall asleep, no matter how tired I felt, was because I couldn’t turn off my brain. My thoughts were running 10,000 miles per hour: thinking about school, going through my to-do lists, obsessing over math questions I got wrong, wishing I could go to sleep, and thinking some more about school. I couldn’t calm down enough to actually fall asleep.

So after an incredibly long day of school and homework and more school, I would spend a miserable hour laying in bed thinking about school some more. It was not fun.

I started to procrastinate getting into bed so I could avoid this hour of stewing in my anxiety – which made the problem even worse. Eventually, I felt like I would never be able to get enough sleep.

But then, I found myself in a situation where my parents basically forced me to consistently get 9 hours of sleep every night, and it was life-changing. Every night, I was in bed by 10:30 and awake by 8:00. I couldn’t say, “Oh, just one more assignment,” or “I’ll just read one more chapter.” Because I knew I couldn’t do any more school work, I found myself spending less and less time thinking about all of the school work I thought I should be doing.

Additionally, the consistent routine allowed me to feel tired and ready for bed before 11:00. I felt a boost in my mood, it took me less time to understand my school work, and I could focus a lot better. Overall, I was a much healthier person.

That’s not to say that all of my anxiety and sleep issues went away immediately. While the nights of staying awake for hours obsessively thinking about school still happened, they were a lot less frequent.

My learning was that I am not [Edward Cullen](https://twilightsaga.fandom.com/wiki/Edward_Cullen) and I require sleep to function, just like everyone else.

### Let Teenagers Take Naps

The average teenager does not get enough sleep. Between school, homework, socializing, and relaxation, teenagers sleep an average of seven hours per night.

**That is not enough.** Teenagers should be getting around **nine hours of sleep** every night in order to account for our brain development and maturation along with physical growth spurts.

The scariest part: getting six hours of sleep for five nights in a row is equivalent to pulling an all-nighter, which we can all agree is [incredibly detrimental](https://greatist.com/live/effects-of-an-all-nighter#The-morning-after) to overall health. In fact, one all-nighter has the same effect on teenagers as a 0.1% blood alcohol level (too drunk to drive).

#### **Reasons to encourage sleeping**

Although getting enough sleep often takes a backseat in favor of additional studying and other homework (for both the parent and the teen), consistent sleep deprivation causes a multitude of problems, including:

* Declining **mood** and increasing **irritability**
* Declining **memory, concentration,** and **motivation**
* **Drowsy driving**
* Increased **depression**
* Reduced **academic** performance (grades, attentiveness in class, turning in assignments on time, etc.)
* Slower **reflexes** and **clumsiness**

Furthermore, according to [Science Daily](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/26079/why-sleeping-may-be-more-important-than-studying), sacrificing “sleep in order to study an extra hour before a test was actually associated with doing more poorly on a test, quiz, or homework,” as was found in a study where high school students’ academic performance was compared based on the hours of sleep each student got.

When we sleep, we store all of the information learned that day. Less sleep means less accumulation of knowledge, leading to teens not remembering everything they spent those extra hours learning.

#### **How to encourage sleeping**

For Parents

* Create an appropriate routine

  + Having limits on homework, along with suggested sleep and wake-up times can create consistency and take the question, “Should I go to bed?” away. Check out [Austin Scholar #8: Work Harder, Not Longer](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-8-work-harder-not?s=w) for more about how creating schedules and habits can help.
* Stay away from early morning doctor appointments

  + This is an easy way to help teenagers get enough sleep every night. Dentists, orthodontists, and other appointments are also included :)
* Let! Them! Sleep! In! On! Weekends!

  + When teenagers sleep in on weekends, they are often called lazy and are told to wake up “at a more reasonable hour.” And yes, while sleeping in by more than two hours past their normal wake up time can interrupt their circadian rhythm, sometimes teenagers really just need sleep. No matter how well they stick to the schedule, some weeks it can be really hard to get enough sleep, so it could be beneficial to let teenagers catch up on sleep Saturday morning every once in a while without calling them lazy.
* Encourage 30-minute naps

  + Because it really can be hard to get enough sleep every night, encouraging naps in the afternoon or before dinner are a great way to help teenagers reset and focus for the rest of the day. See the “On naps” section below for more information on naps :)

For Teens

* Create an appropriate routine

  + Routines, schedules, and habits are what have helped me actually go to sleep instead of staying up to study. Check out [Austin Scholar #8: Work Harder, Not Longer](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-8-work-harder-not?s=w) for more on the importance of creating habits. Getting enough sleep is just as important as working hard enough, so using these same techniques can be super helpful.
* Square breathing

  + While this might seem stupid, finding a breathing pattern to focus on while going to sleep can help you calm anxiety, slow your heart rate, and fall asleep faster. While I don’t do this every night, whenever I’m tired but wide awake, I like to use [square breathing](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-box-breathing#:~:text=Box%20breathing%2C%20also%20referred%20to,decreasing%20stress%20in%20your%20body.) (In 4, Hold 4, Out 4, Hold 4) to calm down.
* Take 30-minute naps

  + I love naps and I think it is absolutely tragic that in-school naps stop after kindergarten. See the “On naps” section below for more information on naps :)
* Take the pressure off falling asleep

  + I used to get so stressed when I was falling asleep because I knew that I was not going to get enough sleep that night. This actually caused me to have more trouble sleeping because I had so much anxiety about not getting enough sleep. The best way I’ve found to combat this is to remind myself that *I will be okay* if it takes me an extra 30 minutes to fall asleep. Sure, I might be tired the next day, but I’ve gotten through the day tired before. It’s not the end of the world.
* Research sleep hygiene if you still struggle with falling asleep

  + I promise, your sleep and sleep quality is worth spending a few minutes researching sleep hygiene. Everyone needs different things when falling asleep, so finding what works best for you in order to fall asleep easily and deeply is super important. For example, I need to wear an eye mask because the pressure on my eyes is a signal that it’s time to sleep. I also can’t sleep without some sort of music or audiobook because having sound in the background helps me focus on that, rather than my to-do list.

#### On naps

I’ve heard a lot of bad things about naps:

> “You won’t be able to sleep.”
>
> “It messes with your circadian rhythm.”
>
> “You’ll be more tired after your nap and won’t be able to get back to work.”

Personally, I think those people are just doing naps wrong.

First of all, according to Science Daily, “Routine nappers, who napped five to seven days in a week, had sustained attention, better nonverbal reasoning ability, and spatial memory,” according to a [study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180425195621.htm) funded by the National Institutes of Health. “Participants who slept between 30 to 60 minutes produced better accuracy in attention tasks as well as faster speed.” Longer than 60 minutes, though, is when it interferes with circadian rhythm.

Ultimately, “[r]esearchers were surprised to find a positive relationship between midday napping and nighttime sleep… Habitual nappers tended to have a better nighttime sleep.”

The overall effects of napping are clearly beneficial and should be encouraged. Rather than having a “homework first” policy, allowing teens to take a 30-minute nap will actually improve homework speed and accuracy. Additionally, taking naps aids in helping teenagers overcome some of the issues associated with a lack of sleep. This is especially important for high school students with early school start times (which is a whole other topic – don’t get me started), as it can be challenging to get the full nine hours of sleep.

Don’t force us to leave naps behind in preschool. Let teenagers take naps.

### Scholar’s Sources

I did a *ton* of research for this newsletter, so I have accumulated quite the list of sources on sleep, and here are a few of my favorites :)

[This article](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/26079/why-sleeping-may-be-more-important-than-studying) about sleeping versus studying is definitely the one that I needed to read this week. The article does a deeper dive into the effects of sleep deprivation on academic performance and provides great logical insights and conclusions about sleeping.

[This blog post](https://www.sitwithariadne.com/2021/07/sleep-hygine-protocol.html) describes ways to fall asleep that come from a more therapy-based background (DBT). The post covers strategies to fall asleep in different scenarios: when you’re anxious, ruminating, catastrophizing, or just wide awake. Also included are ways to get a deeper sleep, which is another important aspect of sleep. My experiences with learning how to fall asleep also came from a therapy background and were extremely effective, so don’t count DBT out!

[This article](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/teenagers-and-sleep-how-much-sleep-is-enough) talks about the differences between younger kids and teenagers in regards to how much sleep they need, why teenagers need so much sleep, and ways to help teenagers get enough sleep. Naps are on the list!

If you want any specific tips to help your teenager to build a healthy sleep schedule, send me a comment!
