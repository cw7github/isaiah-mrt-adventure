### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. How to teach your teenager clear thinking
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

As those of you with high schoolers know, AP exams started this week, and I have to say that I am so proud of [my sister](https://www.tiktok.com/@elle.kristine?lang=en). She has been working so incredibly hard and I wanted to take a moment to shout her out. Not only did she start and finish all of AP chemistry in a month, but she’s also been doing interviews with the Atlantic, meeting with experts in the teenager-development field like Dr. David Yeager, and growing her [AI teen dating coach](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/askelle-ai/id6471620444) to 60,000 downloads on the app store. She is an absolute force and massively impressive junior in high school. Let me know if y’all would like me to interview her or ask her for advice for your kid :)

Everyone please wish her luck on the rest of her exams!!

### How to teach your teenager clear thinking

Last summer, I read Warren Buffett’s biography, which got me really interested in investing. I wrote a [newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-147-three-steps-to) about how I was planning on becoming an expert in investing, and one of my exercises was to ask ChatGPT to generate a list of people who are already experts in investing and what I can learn from them. Of course, Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s partner, was a massive feature on the list. Aside from all of his investing knowledge, I love Munger’s mental models and checklists.

I believe these models, which were originally for financial decisions, can also be a game-changer for how kids approach challenges and build critical thinking skills. A lot of the mental roadblocks investors run into as adults are the same as the mental roadblocks we run into as teens.

Hear me out: I know the two things sound unrelated, but it turns out a lot of the types of problems we run into as teens can also be solved by clear thinking (crazy, right?). And a lot of teenagers haven't gotten the chance to even learn what clear thinking is, let alone how to do it.

With them in mind, I broke down Munger’s principles in a way they can understand, then came up with tips for parents to guide their children in mastering these habits.

Here’s a copy of Charlie Munger’s list of mental models:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yiUW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae9f2243-4e34-4ac2-9585-a14be7aa7fdc_1080x1080.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yiUW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae9f2243-4e34-4ac2-9585-a14be7aa7fdc_1080x1080.png)

Here’s my summary of Charlie Munger’s checklist for clear thinking (adapted for kids)

**Think about risks first:** Think about the impact that your decisions could have on your or your life before acting. Protect your name and always have a backup plan. Don’t associate with sketchy people. Pay attention to the hidden costs to your decisions – would the thing you’re considering doing make someone who you care about angry with you? Hurt? How could you avoid that?

**Think for yourself:** Don’t just do what everyone else is doing. Figure out what’s right by using your own brain, not just following the crowd. Being different can help you stand out in a good way, not just be average.

**Keep learning**: Read. More. Books. Hard work and curiosity pay off. Ask tons of questions like “Why does this happen?” and get prepared for anything – whether it’s a test or a game. Make a plan and don’t do your homework the period before it’s due. Being ready is more important than just wanting to win.

**Be honest about what you don’t know:** Don’t pretend that you know what you’re talking about when you don’t. Listen in conversations when people are talking about things you don’t know. Deluding yourself and others that you’re an expert doesn’t help anyone. Listen when others disagree and don’t pretend to know it all. That’s how you get smarter.

**Take your time:** Don’t rush just because you feel like it. A little bit every day will compound to something amazing. Enjoy the steps along the way, not just the finish line, and wait for the right moments to shine.

**Be brave:** When a great chance comes along, go for it with all you’ve got. Sometimes, do the opposite of what everyone else is doing if you think it’s smart. Big wins come from being ready and bold.

### Charlie Munger’s checklist: Parents’ version

Now, parents, part of your job is creating an environment where your kids feel safe actually embodying these behaviors. Some of this stuff sounds easier than it is, and can be scary for a teenager to embody. Here’s how to guide your kids to become clearer and more critical thinkers:

**Encourage questions:** Create an environment where asking questions is celebrated, not dismissed. When your child asks "why," resist the urge to give a quick answer. Instead, encourage them to think it through by asking follow-up questions like, "What do you think could be the reason?" or "How would you figure that out?" This builds their problem-solving skills and fosters a natural curiosity about the world.

**Be a model:** Kids learn by observing, so let them see your thought processes. For example, when making a family decision (like planning a vacation or budgeting for a new purchase), walk them through the steps: considering pros and cons, weighing risks, and thinking about potential consequences. Use phrases like, "Let’s think about what could go wrong," or "What’s the best way to prepare for this?"

**Think about risks:** Practice scenario-based thinking with your kids. For example, if they’re considering joining a new club or trying a new activity, ask, "What’s the worst that could happen? How would you handle that?" This helps them weigh risks and rewards in a balanced way. You can also teach them about reputation by discussing how actions and decisions affect trust and relationships.

**Encourage independent thinking:** Praise them for forming their own opinions, even if they differ from yours or their peers’. You can do this by asking, "What do you think about that?" when discussing news, books, or even family decisions. Gently challenge them to back up their opinions with reasoning, teaching them the importance of evidence-based thinking.**Teach them how to love learning:** Encourage reading and exploration outside of school. Help them find books, podcasts, or videos on topics they’re passionate about. Show them that lifelong learning isn’t just important, it can also be fun. Lead by example—let them see you reading, researching, and learning new things yourself.

**Help them recognize their circle of competence:** Teach your kids that it’s okay (and even smart) to admit when they don’t know something. When they ask a question you don’t know the answer to, say, "I don’t know either, but let’s find out together." This models humility and shows that learning is a lifelong process. Encourage them to seek advice or guidance from experts or mentors when needed.

**Teach patience:** Explain the concept of "compounding" in a way they can understand—small, consistent efforts lead to big results over time. For example, if they’re working on a school project, break it into manageable chunks and praise them for steady progress. Reward effort as much as outcomes to help them appreciate the journey, not just the destination.**Encourage brave but thoughtful decisions:** Celebrate moments when your child steps out of their comfort zone, even if the result isn’t perfect. Use these moments to discuss what they learned and how they might approach similar situations in the future. If they hesitate to take a chance, remind them that big opportunities often require courage and preparation.

**Show them how to learn from their mistakes:** Teach your kids that mistakes and failures are part of learning. When they experience setbacks, help them analyze what went wrong and what they can do differently next time. Frame failures as lessons rather than defeats, reinforcing the idea that clear thinking includes learning from experience.**Allow disagreements:** Encourage your kids to share their opinions, even if they differ from others in the family. Teach them how to debate respectfully by focusing on ideas, not people. This builds confidence in their ability to think critically and articulate their views.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Efficient learning](https://x.com/justinskycak/status/1919748232428535958)

[2 Hour Learning](https://2hourlearning.com/) is all about efficient learning, so I loved this post about how to make learning more efficient:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h_KU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9926011d-2e0f-4556-9954-b88bbd2224fb_894x900.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h_KU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9926011d-2e0f-4556-9954-b88bbd2224fb_894x900.png)

Here’s a ChatGPT prompt to help you learn concepts more efficiently:

*I want to learn [insert topic here] as efficiently as possible. Use this [insert any pdf, book chapter, website, or text about the topic here] to help me to do so. Please provide me with:*

* *A streamlined, no-BS explanation of the key concepts I need to understand to get started. Keep it concise and focused.*
* *A problem or exercise to apply what I’ve just learned, with clear instructions.*
* *Once I solve the problem, give me a slightly more challenging explanation or concept, followed by another problem or exercise.*
* *Continue this cycle of brief instruction and active problem-solving to help me maximize my learning efficiency and maintain my attention.*

2. [Regrets](https://x.com/gregisenberg/status/1919766165531844615)

The top five regrets of the dying:

1. I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
2. I wish I hadn’t worked so hard. *(Every male patient)* Felt they missed their children’s youth & partner’s companionship.
3. I wish I’d had the courage to express my feelings.
4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5. I wish that I had let myself be happier. Realized happiness was a choice.

I honestly don’t know what to think about this list as I’m only nineteen, but I think these can be turned into guidelines for living my life:

1. Live your life true to yourself
2. Spend time with loved ones
3. Be honest with your feelings
4. Reach out to your friends
5. Choose happiness

Obviously, these are super hard to do, but I’ve been trying to add small habits into my day to get closer to these ideals – for example, calling my family every day, asking friends I haven’t seen since the last quarter for lunch, smiling more, etc.

3. [Read books!!](https://x.com/karenvaites/status/1919717613258621111)

Don’t let your kid go to college without having read a book throughout their entire time in high school. Even though AI can summarize books for school projects or tell you whatever information you want to know, reading helps you think about the world in new ways, and an AI can’t help or force you to do that. It can help to make reading a value in your family – reading together, reading books before watching the corresponding movie, or having a monthly book club.
