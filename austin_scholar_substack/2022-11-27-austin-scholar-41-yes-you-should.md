### **Hey, y'all!**

What if I told you that motivating your kid to do insanely hard things is easier than you think?

And that my dad found the answer through none other than Taylor Swift?

Teens are capable of all the hard things they've been avoiding. You just might have to bribe them.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

Happy Thanksgiving!

I was able to go on a lovely vacation with my family this past week and we did, in fact, do the [awesome gratitude activity I talked about in last week’s newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-40-why-were-teaching). It was quite honestly a great bonding moment and I feel like my family now understands the meaning of gratitude a little bit better :)

Also, this week I passed an incredible personal milestone in my mental health journey. I don't want to get too far into it, but it feels like a huge win for me (and like somewhere I was never sure I'd get to end up), so I was able to celebrate that this week as well.

### Austin’s Anecdote: Taylor Swift Tickets And Distribution

I love Taylor Swift.

I hate working on distribution.

Let me show you how these two things are connected.

My dad likes to say that there are two types of people in this world: those who want to sit by themselves and create all day, and those who want to talk to other people and sell something.

I'm a "sit by myself and create" type of person.

Talking to people is pretty much my least favorite thing in the world. *People are so unpredictable?! And tiring?!*

I always get super embarrassed when my parents talk about my newsletter in front of other adults. I feel like they expect me to have some insightful and pithy pitch to make in the conversation that will inspire them to go subscribe to my newsletter. And, of course, I spend hours overthinking everything I said (or didn't say) during our interaction.

Talking to people can just be... too much for me.

All of which comes as a surprise to all of you, I'm sure, because of the charming wit you've come to know and love from my newsletter ;)

But, alas, I'm only eloquent in writing.

Unfortunately for me, though, I can't expect 10,000 people to magically find my newsletter while I sit alone in my room and write to myself all day. I have to *talk to people*–so they know I exist. Tragic.

My dad and I have many conversations about all of the things that would be so incredibly good for me to do: cold email and cold DM people with a lot of followers, get on podcasts, and ask people to forward my content.

All of which, in theory, make perfect sense.

But, when I sit down to construct the perfect email, the words just... don't work.

And, funnily enough, something always seems to come up during the time I'm supposed to work on distribution. (*You know, I should probably do that Physics homework that's due in 5 days right now. It might be harder than I'm expecting, so I need to start immediately.)*

Every night, when my dad gets home, he asks me about what I've done to work on distribution. Every night, I come up with some fluffy story or excuse: *Well, I wrote the first paragraph of my template cold email. (The first paragraph being, Dear [Name])*. Every night, I get the same lecture on why I need to be focusing on distribution and how, right now, I'm just speaking into the void.

*Yes, Dad, I get it. I just hate talking to people.*

And, whenever I get a bunch of anxiety about my not-yet-created cold DMs, I put on Taylor Swift and have a lip-syncing concert in my bathroom.

I'm not sure if y'all are aware, but Taylor Swift is going on tour next year, and I've been talking non-stop about wanting to go.

When I threw in "I'll do *anything* to go. Anything," my dad came up with an idea that could benefit us both.

He wants me to work on my distribution because he thinks it would be good for my newsletter, or something like that.

I want to go to a Taylor Swift concert because I think it would be good for my entire existence.

So, if I get 10,000 followers on Twitter before her Houston performances (which would require me to cold DM a bunch of people with lots of followers), I get to go to a Taylor Swift concert.

Let me tell you: there isn't going to be another Physics assignment that I can't get done at a different time.

### Yes, You Should Bribe Your Teen (& How To Make Them Do Hard Things)

What you should take away from that anecdote is that yes, you should bribe your kid.

Giving your kid a spectacular prize can make your kid do a ton of challenging academic work–things they didn’t think they could ever do.

When they’re trying to get this super amazing prize, they’ll do whatever it takes to win. And those internal blocks will start to crumble because their desire is stronger than their fear.

They’ll do the uncomfortable so that they can get something they really want.

They'll learn very quickly that they actually *can* do all the things they thought they couldn't.

And once they feel like they can, in fact, do these super cool, hard things, they’ll be more willing to do them on their own–without a prize at the end.

Bribes start out as extrinsic motivation, but the progress very quickly leads to intrinsic motivation.

If you want ideas for what types of goals to use, check out Scholar’s Sources.

Now, why Taylor Swift?

I’ve been using Taylor Swift tickets as my example prize, but why?

Well, Taylor Swift broke basically every record in the music industry, and deep down every teenager wants to go to one of her concerts. But as an added bonus, the timeframe is perfect for my academic goals–and probably for your kids, too.

The tour starts in late March, which gives your kid until right before finals and AP tests to meet their goals.

Also, Taylor Swift tickets are expensive and can be hard to get, so both you and your kid will have to put in work to meet this goal.

Finally, going to this concert together can be a super special night that you can share with your kid–and a night that shows how hard work (from both you and your kid) can really pay off.

I can tell you first-hand how motivating this is.

*Parents, if you want your kid to meet challenging academic goals, forward them this section:*

Hey, guys. I know there’s something really, really incredible that you wish for with your whole heart. Like tickets to a Taylor Swift concert.

Whatever that thing is, maybe it’s hard to get. Maybe it’s super expensive.

Maybe your parents have already said “no.”

What if I told you that there was a way for you to convince your parents to get you those tickets?

It’s going to require some hard work from you, but it’s possible.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to getting Taylor Swift tickets:

**Step 1: Come up with something that your parents think is “good for you” but that you hate.**

You know that thing that your parents keep telling you to do but you just really don’t want to? Well, it’s time to agree to do it.

Getting Taylor Swift tickets is going to require you to challenge yourself and do something that you never thought you could ever do–or even want to try.

Your parents are going to have to make some sacrifices to get the tickets, so if you want them to agree, they’ll want you to make some sacrifices, too.

**Step 2: Write down an impressive, tangible goal that would impress your parents.**

Just saying, “I’m going to do better in math” or “I’m going to read more” won’t convince your parents.

You need to come out of the gate strong and show them that you will put in the work to get these tickets.

Make your goal [SMART](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals).

**Step 3: Present your brilliant idea.**

Okay. Now, you have a great plan that gives both you and your parents something that they want.

But, you still have to actually convince your parents to agree. This is where your presentation skills come in.

Spend a few minutes creating a slide deck and short script that will display the benefits of your plan. (Parents really like slide shows–trust me.) Make sure to include a slide with the deal stated clearly and concisely, a slide that shows your plan for achieving this goal, and a slide that shows what your parents will get out of agreeing to the plan.

Then, channel your inner [Elle Woods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I_GYgGjxFM) and persuade your parents to get you Taylor Swift tickets in exchange for an unbelievable achievement.

**Step 4: Work really hard.**

These goals require a ton of deep, challenging work from you to be achieved. You have to make this a priority in your life.

When it feels impossible, use Taylor Swift as your guiding light and inspiration. Picture yourself at that concert. That image will propel you forward and give you the motivation you need to continue.

(Also, getting the tickets is probably going to be hard work for your parents, too. Work together. Y’all got this.)

**Step 5: Go to the Taylor Swift concert.**

Now, your hard work pays off. You crushed it. Be proud of yourself and scream [All Too Well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tollGa3S0o8) at the top of your lungs.

### Scholar’s Sources: Resources To Help You With Your Taylor Swift-Worthy Goals

If you and your teen aren’t sure where to start with setting their super challenging, Taylor Swift-worthy goals, here are a few resources that might help:

If you don’t already know what SMART goals are, check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpKvs-apvOs). It goes in-depth on each letter of the acronym and why it’s important for goals (high schoolers’ goals especially) to be SMART.

[This blog post](https://www.pondercollege.com/blog/goal-setting-for-high-school-students) is an absolutely fantastic piece for parents that goes through good goals for high school students, how to pick the right goal, how to make the goals SMART, and how to keep your teen on track.

If you want an example of an insanely challenging, academically rewarding goal, have your kid try a course on [Outlier](https://www.outlier.org/). Outlier offers an actual college course and credit from the University of Pittsburgh. The courses are online and semi-self-paced (you can complete the lessons whenever, but there are scheduled midterms and finals). I absolutely adored the Calculus course I took on Outlier last year, and I definitely think that taking one of these courses would be a Taylor Swift-worthy goal for your teen.
