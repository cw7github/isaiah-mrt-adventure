### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How Stanford convinced me students can learn better with apps than with teachers
2. Online apps wrapped (2024)
3. Scholar’s Sources: My 5-star reads of 2024

Everyone (some of my classmates included) was worried about how Alpha High students would perform in college. Learning with a teacher for the first time in years has to come with some challenges, right?

What if we didn’t actually learn anything with the apps? Are we really prepared for college-level coursework?

Well, I’m happy to report that I got straight A’s in my first quarter and have a 4.0 GPA. The rest of my friends (all at different schools) had the same story – all A’s and a 4.0 GPA. I guess online apps do work, huh?

While I’ll be taking next week off from newsletter writing for Christmas, get ready for a super punchy, controversial, and fascinating newsletter for the first week of January. I plan to start off with a bang!

### Austin’s Anecdote: How Stanford convinced me students can learn better with apps than with teachers

One comment I’ve gotten on a multitude of my posts on X is that I don’t *really* know if apps are better than teachers because I haven’t really experienced learning any other way. Since starting at Alpha in the fourth grade, all of my learning has been through online apps. Which means my critics are right – it’s true that (before college) I hadn’t learned from a teacher in eight years.

However, I did just complete my first quarter at Stanford – which is the best educational institute in the world, which makes it the perfect place to compare with adaptive apps.

And in the competition between the professors at Stanford and online apps, I’m happy (or sad?) to report that online apps still win.

I have a few reasons for this:

1. Your success in a class should not depend on your teacher

Whether you can’t understand a teacher’s accent or you got stuck with a teacher notorious for grading more harshly than average, there are thousands of different ways that your teacher impacts your understanding (and grades) in a class.

The TA for my math class said that a lot of the grading of our exams depends on the mood of the TA who’s grading our paper.

On the other hand, with apps, education is standardized. Every student gets the same high quality explanation of concepts and the same level of intensity in grading.

Every student is given the same chance to succeed in the class.

2. Content is not adaptive

I’ve talked about this extensively in previous newsletters, but I’ve finally gotten to see this concept play out.

It is a fact that every single person in a classroom has a different knowledge base and has different gaps in their learning.

Thus, it is impossible to effectively teach every student.

During my math class, for example, there were people who didn’t fully understand integration by parts and had a multitude of questions surrounding this idea. However, this was not the point of our lesson – we were instead learning about finding integrals to infinity.

So the professor had two options:

* Ignore the questions and move on with the lesson
* Explain integration by parts and not have enough time to get to the original lesson of finding integrals to infinity

In either case, some students would not be able to learn what they need to.

That is why I love apps. Every student can learn the content at their own pace and the adaptability allows the students who don’t understand previous concepts to get supplemental material while the students who are ready for new material can get started.

3. Human error

In multiple scenarios, my math professor received a question from a student asking her to explain something she’d written on the board and when she looked to explain it, she realized she’d written something incorrectly and had to go back and re-explain the problem.

One of my friends asked the professor about a question she had on the homework, and the professor said her answer was correct. When my friend got her homework graded, she did not, in fact, get that question correct.

I hate to say it, but humans are, unfortunately, subject to making mistakes.

And while some of those mistakes might not mean much, some of those mistakes could end up in a student getting told the exact opposite of the correct solution and ruin their understanding of a concept.

I’m not blaming humans for making mistakes, I’m just stating the unfortunate consequences of them – and when compared with an online app, it’s really no contest.

I have enjoyed my education at Stanford so far and I know I’m incredibly lucky to be at such an institution, but I do have to say that online apps remain my favorite way to learn.

### Online apps wrapped (2024)

I thought I’d take space here to talk about the apps that I – and other Alpha students – have used this year and recommend some for you!

Apps (& online resources) I used:

1. [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/)

Math Academy was my favorite app find of this year. [I’ve written](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-130-how-and-why-to) about how to use Math Academy effectively, but my high level analysis is that the app is a fantastic introduction to concepts and helps students solve basic questions on every topic extremely well – and uses learning science techniques to ensure mastery. However, Math Academy doesn’t really get into the ten-step word problem questions, so you’ll have to use practice SAT questions or an app like [Albert](https://www.albert.io/) for that.

2. [Outlier](https://www.outlier.org/)

If you want to experience a college class, Outlier is perfect for you. Its College Writing I course was almost identical to the Stanford first year writing curriculum. The app itself isn’t adaptive, but you can work through all of the content at your own pace. All of the best, most engaging professors record lectures (so they’re not boring) and the quiz and test questions are all super aligned with the content in the lessons (unlike Stanford math classes). You’re basically getting the best college learning experience out there.

3. [Fiveable](https://fiveable.me/)

Fiveable is great for an overview of high school course content and *very* basic practice questions. I used it all throughout high school and found its explanations helpful. It’s not, however, adaptive and requires you to pick the modules and lessons to learn on your own.

4. [AP Daily](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/instructional-resources/ap-daily)

This may seem like a basic resource, but if you use these videos and combine them with [Heimler’s History](https://www.youtube.com/@heimlershistory) or [Marco Learning](https://www.youtube.com/@MarcoLearning) YouTube videos, it’s all you need to get a 5 on an AP history or AP Language exam. I used [Albert](https://www.albert.io/) for practice exams and questions, but learned all of the content for those exams through these AP Daily videos.

My opinions combined with other Alpha students’ experiences, here are my recommendations for your kid:

For younger kids, use [IXL](https://www.ixl.com/).

The app has adaptive tests and lesson plans to make your kid’s learning completely personalized and mastery-based. IXL covers basically every major topic in K-12 education and is a fantastic resource to use to help your kid either catch up or get ahead in their educational journey.

If your kid is interested in getting through a lot of math content, use [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/).

Read [this previous](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-130-how-and-why-to) newsletter to learn how to implement it in your kid’s life.

If your kid wants to learn college-level content (and get college credit for their work), use [Outlier](https://www.outlier.org/). My number one recommendation for every kid is their College Writing I course, as it prepares students for actual college writing.

If your kid needs AP resources, use [Fiveable](https://fiveable.me/) or [AP Daily](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/instructional-resources/ap-daily), as mentioned above.

There is an app out there to suit your kid’s needs. If you aren’t able to find it here, please reach out to me and I’ll happily talk through your situation with you and come up with a plan to support your kid.

### Scholar’s Sources: My 5-star reads of 2024

Despite falling eight books short of my goal to read fifty books this year (I had significantly less time to read in college than I had expected), I still read some incredible pieces this year that I’d love to share with you.

Here are my five 5-star reads of 2024:

1: [The Cartiers](https://www.the-cartiers.com/)

*The Cartiers* is an extremely dense book – and with over 500 pages, it’s definitely a commitment. But I learned *so* much through both reading and musing over this book months later. The piece is filled with insights on why you should do things that don’t scale, how marketing has changed, the power of high quality products, how to find innovation in unexpected places, and so much more. *The Cartiers* was my first 5-star read of the year and one of my favorite books I’ve ever read.

2 & 3: [Dune](https://www.amazon.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert/dp/0441172717) & [Children of Dune](https://www.amazon.com/Children-Dune-Frank-Herbert/dp/0593098242/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_3/147-9002980-4192164?pd_rd_w=AjRaX&content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_r=W2N410RC77DGAPNDKD7H&pd_rd_wg=RmUDT&pd_rd_r=693e46ab-18df-4eb6-ba1f-c93a481a6a74&pd_rd_i=0593098242&psc=1)

Right after I watched the *Dune* movies I immediately went to purchase the book. The *Dune* world is so fascinating and fosters great conversation with my dad about science fiction and what it means to be a hero. I actually found the writing style to be super clear and manageable (and is a great novel to purchase as a last-minute gift for any Timothee Chalamet-obsessed teenagers).

The third novel held a fascinating debate between a father and son about both the idea that “hard times make great men” *and* the challenge of hurting yourself – condemning yourself to a life of misery – for the greater good.

Honestly, the entire *Dune* series is incredible, but the first and third novels were definitely stand-outs for me.

4 & 5: [Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/Foundation-Isaac-Asimov-ebook/dp/B000FC1PWA/ref=sr_1_2?crid=IZMH9V0FZJQB&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.5mayUFKKuus3l7cLnLO9uIqer5eLjVyxluGLX2yY0O4Jyn3xjQS-hyhLdHGXhYw-WPuPKM9Y6c8YksfE2TXrNouNufWAsAEOyvdYrOkkF_QDK51_IwktKOU5Yx5qPX8H_kdE75h8c9Uziycu07TNt_mnTJ7uVz429jeWf__aw2-BTiNxu1hn5AT7KW4Kq_yUuVVeXH2XHF0sctWLBpmtMv959p0E2k5clgV61mtjFtc.4Z3xxKsdfSWsnfM6Ll2ZwWd_AMLCtr7wjdHmjH9qGZY&dib_tag=se&keywords=foundation&qid=1734552809&s=books&sprefix=foundation%2Cstripbooks%2C130&sr=1-2) & [Second Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/Second-Foundation-Isaac-Asimov-ebook/dp/B000FC1PWU/ref=sr_1_1?crid=38E4KPSO5NJX0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.mpKhxVfnsA3nqjLpfV3Zzvr2BH0Xga74Nmwya1AnVcbSg_otp-lXUsEFjPb9RIgr29HRbC47702dP7ZPM-bptAnfWBgf_F-T5-4RSTicG5235y-nzov7sMCGQ6dLa5-83ja2_IqgXkuCPAu0OOqbwYfrxVpOhStRkQhAUd82ao13WAEkvhU4nEONvjQy0mvK-LJDijTeJ2ITxgtSH46gBpWQg4Jl8kyZ-vy_a6VPu_o.GhdVuBH5QWe7bTD0O_EdSGPg_URzBy_dZFN_gFO5nAA&dib_tag=se&keywords=second+foundation&qid=1734552832&s=books&sprefix=second+foundation%2Cstripbooks%2C108&sr=1-1)

*Foundation* is almost an antithesis of *Dune*. Both cover the preservation of society, but go about it in extremely different ways. *Foundation* is about preservation, while *Dune* is about progress.

*Second Foundation* (the third book in the series)felt especially interesting to me because the “Second Foundation-ers” almost act as a higher power controlling the lives of everyone in the Foundation Empire. And they have the power of emotional control, so it brings up questions of free will and inevitability. Such a thought-provoking novel – and it wraps up the entire story extremely well.

I have to also share my honorable mentions – these books are fantastic and were 4.5/5 stars for me :)

1: [The Joy of X](https://www.amazon.com/Joy-Guided-Tour-Math-Infinity-ebook/dp/B006R8PL7G/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3RLF43FVU64H2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vsS54LkUcwxNLwbxb-py2rUA3uIqV6lzgiRBMZz5GXMbZCvAZaKH2D3AbEgsk0nLOmbABjhdhEMiYGSfjFta4_e98FqGu_1HOSwFnqvgCxbFHXSSG-DdYHo5dMQhlbGRDsbx3ucuemsM4JDxwJH_dAsyQqWrGljlOVZ9aMeCcd0bFUOBvTocN4hS9KsHJgIs2afWOaG-_5iwBU6HCEUYLQgEUglbmPLsU_lvS-BIIz0.S_ZMHgUN9uXRzTpe3v6x9JWbBxZVgjNhQYxGC95QlVc&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+joy+of+x&qid=1734552845&s=books&sprefix=the+joy+of+%2Cstripbooks%2C133&sr=1-1)

*The Joy of X* is a vibrant exploration into the history and significance of mathematics, covering everything from one and basic arithmetic to infinity and calculus. I’m absolutely obsessed with the way Strogatz breaks down complex concepts and relates them to engaging stories and hypotheticals. For example, in his chapter on the number *e*, Strogatz explains the optimal number of people you should date in your lifetime to increase your chances of finding your perfect match – something interesting to everyone. Most of all, though, I love this book because it perfectly intertwines my two favorite subjects: math and writing. *The Joy of X* is evidence of the close relationship between science and art – and how to utilize one to make sense of the other.

2: [Snowball](https://www.amazon.com/Snowball-Warren-Buffett-Business-Life-ebook/dp/B009MYD9F8/ref=sr_1_1?crid=24S2NUZUFFWZH&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.A9caaPSVqRFjHyCyr4P6lhNCisr79f_45I7eZMYWmm3CudS38KDWZAS1aUmtOJKKAlbIKk2otzMDt0XT5QV4Rgzm3JB8jA6xoGygm7zvK-CIBxEft3y2ld1BDepFk12hMGNtb8MNasRQOlB8di2jVWv1I44UmaZRoJ4XKv750WYr_e6dI4vJJHgXp0sLU2g8b1UQMduXXwEcNspU87ek1q2W-FOi2L-876S-Fgyo49Q.0xjffttYdcHMkfk41R6PoDaM3PyKs92nbkO8Ok6rRoE&dib_tag=se&keywords=snowball&qid=1734552864&s=books&sprefix=snowbal%2Cstripbooks%2C132&sr=1-1)

Warren Buffet’s biography was so lovely to read – from scandals at insurance companies to failures with shoe companies to becoming the world’s richest man, the number one thing that stayed consistent was his integrity and refusal to compromise his values. His opinion was trusted throughout the business and financial world because he had never once said or suggested something he himself didn’t believe in.

Another key part of the biography was the emphasis on starting young – the earlier you begin, the bigger your snowball can get. Buffet had been creating small businesses and visiting banks since before he was a teenager. There’s no minimum age requirement to make money.

Aside from the investing advice (my favorites being that Mr. Market throws out random numbers every day, and buy if that number is below your value of a company and sell if it’s over along with always having a margin of safety – don’t buy at $4 if you think the value is $5, wait until it gets to $2), I was truly just struck by the way Buffet stayed true to his values and beliefs. My goal is to feel as secure in who I am that I can do the same.

3: [Lady Tan’s Circle of Women](https://www.amazon.com/Lady-Tans-Circle-Women-Novel-ebook/dp/B0BHTPR5BK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3F4QP0WV3FKCE&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vnJSvEi_2CUY4pNd0Y-W6VKLTQHpfa777WRd5kE3roU0SvEsEomUosMQO2ratLIfvdMxelcscl8voPi_eQWTFIRkM2XLI_K0xhSGf31ujMcxScKGTZcWYHE7L4Cn14Ddcsz9DWGYsMeF1cOpuJuOJ94OtHG9kaOmK-MzpQKl-4CzvYO-tRSZNkiEFZsYonKveyVKGXuuttrwWkPBv-72okDX7wuWsMsK0ooMxM3B9GU.bBTIvIGEgqvryF-aAK0aY3lIOvBzhcSoRZsxu1VUyGk&dib_tag=se&keywords=lady+tan%27s+circle+of+women+by+lisa+see&qid=1734552884&s=books&sprefix=lady+t%2Cstripbooks%2C138&sr=1-1)

*Lady Tan’s Circle of Women* is one of the best books I’ve read this year. It’s a perfect balance between a masterful showcase of prose and an engaging plot. The descriptions of food, dress, and buildings in fifteenth-century China immerse you into the story while the conflict between dreams and expectations keeps you turning the page.
