### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: Advice from a Stanford freshman
2. How AI will transform university education
3. Scholar’s Sources: How to become an expert (as written by Austin Scholar)

My midterms are over! And my studying paid off. I’m super happy with how I performed on my Math 51 midterm and have already started studying for the final so I can maintain that success. Here is the ChatGPT prompt I used to study:

*I just attached the pdf version of a chapter of my math textbook. I am studying for a super challenging exam and want to make sure I understand every concept in this chapter. Please explain the main concepts like I’m five years old*.

Once I get the basic idea down (usually explained in some form of building Legos or playing with a robot), I’ll ask for a step-by-step equation for how to solve each question type mentioned in the chapter.

*For every example given in this chapter, please create a step-by-step formula for solving these questions and relate it to the concepts you previously explained.*

Finally, I’ll ask Chat to create questions that are similar to those in the textbook and, if I’m unable to solve them, ask Chat to walk me through every step.

And that’s how I improved my midterm grade by over ten points!

### Austin’s Anecdote: Advice from a Stanford freshman

A few weeks ago, I wrote a [newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-149-how-my-classmates) about how two of my classmates got into Stanford.

I know that I have a lot of readers who want their kids to get into an Ivy-Plus university. So (if y’all end up liking it) I’ve decided to make the Anecdote section pieces of advice every week from students who were admitted to Stanford, MIT, Harvard, Princeton, and more.

This first week, I talked to Annabelle Chang, an 18-year-old founder of [Annabelle’s Book Club](https://annabellesbookclubla.com/), a bookstore in LA.

I asked her *what, with 20-20 hindsight, is the best advice you wish you could’ve given to your parents as they supported you on your journey of both becoming a business owner and getting into Stanford? What would you want them to do the same? What would you want them to do differently?*

“I’m lucky to have incredibly supportive parents who have always encouraged me to pursue my passions — both in and outside of the classroom — so I’m not sure that there are any major things I would want them to do differently, but there are certainly many I would want them to do the same.

When I decided that I wanted to open a young adult-focused bookstore and presented a detailed business plan, they were extremely enthusiastic and have been with me every step of the way: helping me unload books on opening day, attending every one of our author events, and, most recently, traveling to Austin with me to hear me speak at SXSW EDU.

Similarly, when I decided that I wanted to transfer to an online high school so that I could launch my bookstore while still attending rigorous classes, they agreed that it was important to choose the path that worked best for me, even if it looked a bit different than some of my sisters’ and friends’.

Whether it was opening the bookstore or deciding to apply to Stanford, their advice has always been the same: follow your passions, because when you are excited about something, that enthusiasm will come through to other people, too.”

### How AI will transform university education

I’m not going to lie: this newsletter is pretty abstract and less concrete than I typically like to do, but I’m always asked what the future of AI in education will look like, and my classmates and I have been talking about this a lot.

I expect this to be the first in a multi-part series. There’s a lot to dig into, and my thoughts are still evolving, so feel free to skip the theories until I post a condensed summary in a few weeks.

But there’s a lot I want to get into today. In the next section, I have included exercises on how to become an expert in a topic using AI, so you can scroll down to that if you’re not interested in high-level AI musings.

A common question I get asked (often by kindergarten moms) is what the future of school will look like when AI “already knows everything”? Do we even need to learn anything? Or can we just use ChatGPT for everything?

To date, most of my newsletter content has been about K-12, with just the [occasional focus](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-146-how-stanford-convinced) on university. But Stanford has a course series for freshmen called COLLEGE 101 that really focuses on the question, “Why College?” We talk about why we’re at Stanford, what we want to get out of our education, and how to structure our experience to make sure we achieve our goals. The aim of the series is to help you make the best of your four years.

Unfortunately, this curriculum was clearly created largely before the integration of AI into our everyday lives. Because it feels so outdated, some of my classmates and I have talked about how we would design the COLLEGE curriculum with a much heavier emphasis on AI and its effects on university and graduate studies.

It’s hard to understand the full ramifications, but I think you may find our first draft of thoughts interesting.

Our first insight is that AI and LLMs reduce the half-life of knowledge from ten years to one year. Let me explain what this means:

For most of modern history, if you graduated Stanford after learning, say, a programming language, for the next ten years, that language would be valuable. At the end of ten years, it would probably be half as valuable to know as it was the day you graduated, and it would be time to refresh your skills by adding a new programming language.

(Stanford would probably claim that it only teaches you timeless knowledge, but many things that actually get you jobs have a half-life.)

AI and LLMs bring the half-life of a new programming skill down to a year – maybe even less. How can you have a four year education when the knowledge only lasts a year? Many of my classmates in computer science feel like everything they’re learning this year is a complete waste of time because it will be obsolete by their sophomore year, never mind when they graduate.

One CS student had a forty hour homework assignment. A new AI came out that did it in one hour.

I have pre-med classmates who are looking at spending over ten more years in school and, already, AI can diagnose problems better than fifty percent of doctors can. It used to be that you would go to school and largely be up-to-date on the diagnoses and treatments as you enter the workforce. You might have to continue to read articles or studies as new drugs or diagnoses come out, but you definitely didn’t think that, every few months, there would be a new version of AI that diagnoses and treats patients in innovative ways.

So what’s a Stanford freshman to do? Just as AI takes away by reducing the half-life of knowledge from ten years to just one, it also gives, because it allows freshman to do things that previously only masters students and PhD students could do. LLMs allow you to get to the edge of human knowledge quickly without requiring a masters program. And with learning science and AI tutors that teach kids so much faster, you don’t have to spend six years in school. You can use these tools to get to the edge of human knowledge as a freshman.

So my CS friends aren’t waiting for Stanford to come up with a new curriculum; instead, they’re trying to get to the edge of knowledge as quickly as they can.

AI is giving us superpowers.

Beyond just getting to the edge of knowledge, we’ve been asking the question, can AI allow us to do what only PhDs used to do and create new knowledge to add to humanity’s knowledge graph.

While historically, AI has not been great at creating new knowledge on its own, it assists humans who are already at the edge of human knowledge to create new knowledge. AI is a fabulous tool to help you realize if you are creating new knowledge. For example, if I asked AI to help me design a school, it would say, “go hire a good teacher and put them in front of a classroom.” If instead, I said, no, build me a school with no teachers, AI is going to reject that and tell me it doesn’t work.

Because I know that it does, I can tell that I am creating new knowledge.

LLMs have read everything on the internet, so they’re great at helping you understand the boundary of what we know, and that’s why it’s so good at helping you get to a master’s level of education. But if you’re creating new knowledge, the AI won’t be able to understand.

So if the AI fights you, you know that you’re on the right track.

One of the things my Alpha friends in college have noticed is that Alpha taught us all to be self-driven learners and that is giving us a huge leg up at the university level and why we all have 4.0 GPAs. The skill is the key thing schools need to teach students so they can utilize AI to the best of its ability to support their mastery and creation of new knowledge.

AI is going to radically transform education and commoditize knowledge by dramatically reducing its half-life. But on the flip side, it’s going to enable every college student to do what previously only PhDs could do. And I expect that ten years from now, the human knowledge graph will be a hundred or a thousand times bigger than it is now because AI assisted humans in creating immense amounts of knowledge.

### Scholar’s Sources: How to become an expert (as written by Austin Scholar)

**[Three steps to learn anything](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-147-three-steps-to)**

The above article is an incredibly in-depth analysis on how to become an expert in anything, but here is the overhead summary:

1. Find the existing experts (ask Perplexity “Who are the most established experts in X?” and read about them)
2. Create a curated feed (ask Grok for a list of accounts about your topic and your experts, create a list with them, and spend thirty minutes per day engaging with the content)
3. Create your BrainLift (start by finding and learning the common facts (through popular books, video series, websites, etc.), then move on to summarizing and synthesizing content by experts (the ones you found on X!), and finally begin to form your own spiky POVs (what connections have you made in this area that no one else has?))

**[How to prompt AI](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-134-a-new-harvard)**

If your kid is struggling in school, you don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars on a tutor; you just need to learn how to prompt AI.

Here’s a base prompt I’ve used before my math lectures:

*Please teach me this lesson in [topic]. Use the following best teaching practices:*

* *proactively engaging the student in the learning process*
* *managing information overload*
* *supporting and promoting a growth mindset*
* *moving from basic to complex concepts, while preparing for future units*
* *giving the student timely, specific and accurate feedback and information*
* *while enabling the learner to set their own pace*

*Quiz me after each topic to ensure I'm learning it. Separate each topic. Use an engaging tone. Only begin the next topic after I've gotten a question correct.*

Note: the “best teaching practices” were taken straight from the [Harvard Gazette article](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/09/professor-tailored-ai-tutor-to-physics-course-engagement-doubled/).

Here’s what it might look like:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!podF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faacceaa6-e8a1-476f-a040-4bea128c179b_1206x1146.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!podF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faacceaa6-e8a1-476f-a040-4bea128c179b_1206x1146.png)

**[How to use AI to a learning plan](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-60-why-and-how-your)**

A learning plan is a written step-by-step plan on how to become an expert in a topic. To create a learning plan, you choose a subject or concept, then create smaller categories that make up all the things you must learn in order to fully understand the topic. Next, choose methods of learning to attain these goals, which can be books, videos, articles, etc. Finally, set an objective test to pass to prove that you’ve sufficiently mastered your concept.

A learning plan should be detailed enough so that if you gave it to someone who knows nothing about that topic, they would be able to follow your step-by-step plan to become an expert.

For example: I am currently struggling with AP Physics. I used ChatGPT to create a learning plan to ensure I get a 5 on the AP.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WeMZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31b63393-0c72-42c4-9355-4f65b7245e3c_1432x906.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WeMZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31b63393-0c72-42c4-9355-4f65b7245e3c_1432x906.png)

(There were more categories, but I didn’t include them in the picture.)

Knowing how to make learning plans isn’t limited to strictly academic topics. Your kid will be learning and mastering skills for the rest of their life, and knowing how to create a learning plan will put them dramatically ahead of their peers.

*The ChatGPT prompt: Create a learning plan on [SUBJECT]. Include the main categories I will need to learn and what I can study to master them. Include YouTube channels and videos, articles, and practice problems.*

The overall theme here is that AI is your friend – work alongside these tools to help you consume information at unprecedented speeds and begin creating new knowledge.
