### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How to get your kid to read
2. America’s reading problem
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

This weekend I’m going to the Stanford Admitted Students Weekend!! I get to stay in a dorm and go to events, and get a taste of what life at Stanford will look like. I’m so excited!!

In other news, Taylor Swift dropped her album recently and there has been *a lot* of discourse about it on social media. If your kid is at all interested in pop culture or Taylor Swift, I would definitely recommend talking with them about it – I’ve had great conversations with my parents about what and who the songs are about, whether the production is good, and the ranking of this album among her others.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How to get your kid to read

I love reading.

Anything from JK Rowling to Kurt Vonnegut to Emily Dickinson – stories captivate me.

At this point, it’s kind of something I’m known for: I’m Austin and I love to read.

*Can you help me get my kid to read?* you might be wondering.

Trust me: you don’t need them to have an intrinsic love of reading in order to get them to read books.

Here are a few tips:

* Read books that have movies or TV shows that go with them

This is actually how I started reading the *Dune* series – my friend and I watched the movie together and immediately wanted to read the book to learn more about the world and characters. You can do it that way (watching before reading), or instead make it so your kid has to read the book before they’re allowed to watch the movie. My parents did that with the *Brave* movie and I read the entire *Brave* book in one afternoon.

* Do a family reading challenge

Modeling the behavior you want to see from your kid is key. Challenge the whole family to read one book in one week – spend thirty minutes to an hour reading together before bed. Create a culture where reading is something commonly done – and enjoyed – in your family.

* Pay your kid to read

Nothing motivates kids more than money. Give them $5 for every 350+ page book they read, and they’ll be prolific readers before you know it. Simple, but effective.

* Take them to libraries and bookstores

This one is so simple – even just going to a bookstore for thirty minutes one weekend with your kid can be enough to get them interested. Bring them to a section that seems interesting (not to stereotype, but YA romance novels can capture almost any girl’s attention, and sci-fi or fancy finance-bro non-fiction books make a lot of boys feel smart). Let them read the backs of some books and see what piques their interest.

### America’s reading problem

There are actually a lot of problems with reading in America – and it’s not just that kids don’t love to read books.

More than ⅔ of students in America *can’t* read. At least not at grade level. And a lot of this comes down to our country's approach to reading instruction.

There have always been two schools of thought in teaching kids how to read: phonics versus the “whole word” method.

Essentially, phonics teaches kids the sounds of each letter, while the “whole word” method has kids memorize the appearance of words rather than sounding them out.

Though phonics is the older of the two approaches, by the 1950s, the “whole word” approach to reading dominated classrooms. But there are a lot of problems with it.

“Memorizing or guessing the meaning of whole words is not reading; on the contrary, it is an acquired bad habit that stands in the way of your child’s ever learning to read properly.” – Rudolf Flesch, *Why Johnny Can’t Read, 1955*

The fully “whole word” method approach continued in most classrooms until the 1990s, when “balanced literacy” emerged. Balanced literacy attempts to combine both phonics and the “whole word” method – but it miserably fails.

Why isn’t it working?

First, because it’s a combination of approaches, it’s left to each teacher to independently determine how to implement it.

As one district supervisor puts it: “Give kids lots of good books, and with some guidance and enough practice, they become readers.” Except, kids need more instruction than just “some guidance,” but there’s no clear playbook for teachers to be running.

Second, it’s not a “true compromise.” Because the emphasis isn’t on phonics, students still learn how to read by guessing words rather than sounding them out – which is easy to get wrong.

And yet, the education system refuses to transition to methods that actually work.

“A [National Reading Panel’s] research showed that explicitly teaching children the relationship between sounds and letters improved reading achievement. The panel concluded that phonics lessons help kids become better readers. There is no evidence to say the same about whole language.”

At Alpha School, we too had succumbed to the “balanced literacy” catastrophe, as many of the popular online apps (which Alpha School students use to learn instead of teachers) only taught this way.

But we noticed something wasn’t right.

Kids weren’t actually learning how to read in this program – just how to memorize and guess. And the test scores reflected that.

In order to fix this, earlier this year, we threw balanced literacy out the window. We introduced two new online apps that taught kids how to read exclusively through phonics.

And wow, did that change everything.

Kids who used to not be able to read at all grew over an ENTIRE grade level in just FOUR months.

Here are some examples of what the data for our students looks like:

It’s beyond clear that the phonics instruction is superior.

And even more than just teaching kids to read better, phonics instruction is linked to higher levels of reading comprehension in students throughout their academic careers.

If schools actually want their kids to know how to read, they MUST ditch the “whole word” approach disguised as “balanced literacy.”

In the meantime, parents – use phonics.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been up to…

1. [The Anxious Generation](https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036) and [this review](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-coddling-of-the-american-parent)

As someone on the education and parenting side of Twitter/X, I’ve heard raving reviews about *The Anxious Generation* by Jonathan Haidt. Because of that, although I hadn’t read the book, I heard it had some super interesting points about social media’s negative effects on kids. And then earlier this week, I read a review of the book that explains how the author cherry-picked data and disregarded every study (of which there were many) that disproved his point.

Social media is such a huge part of teens’ lives these days that there’s no topic better for a “both sides” debate. I’d recommend y’all talk through both the book and the review and discuss both sides of the argument as a family.

2. [God Emperor of Dune](https://www.amazon.com/God-Emperor-Dune-Frank-Herbert/dp/0593098250)

I’m on book four of the *Dune* series and my goodness, has it gotten crazy. My best friend and I are reading the book together and we spent thirty minutes straight basically screaming about everything going on.

This is such a great series to read with someone – there’s so many conversation topics about themes and plot points and politics.

3. [Austin Scholar #12: Managing May](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-12-managing-may)

AP season has arrived!! If you have a high schooler, they are probably stressed out of their mind. Luckily, I’ve written about how to help your kid navigate through the anxiety and craziness of the month of May, so definitely check this newsletter out for tips and resources.

It’s crazy that this was written over 100 newsletter editions ago – don’t judge my writing from two years ago :)
