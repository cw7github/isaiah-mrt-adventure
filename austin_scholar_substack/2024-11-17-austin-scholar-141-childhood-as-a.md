### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How the Hero’s Journey transformed the way I look at the world
2. Childhood as a hero’s journey (& tricking your kid into becoming a problem-solver)
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

I cried last week for the first time since the quarter started. As incredible as it is to be a student at Stanford, it’s still really, really hard. Overwhelm, duck syndrome (looking fine on the surface while really you’re struggling underwater), missing family and friends, being in a new place, classes, constant midterms, hate comments on my newsletter…it all catches up with you at some point.

In my newsletters, I feel like I try to always put up an “I have everything managed” front, but I’m learning firsthand that everyone will have their ups and downs – life does not run smoothly. And the cool thing about that situation – instead of wallowing, I went to dinner with my friends and watched an episode of a trashy reality TV show. And after? Instead of still being overwhelmed, I felt proud of how I helped myself.

(Heads up: the third source for Scholar’s Sources this week is my favorite thing I’ve read in a while – it will tell you the secret to raising exceptional kids.)

### Austin’s Anecdote: How the Hero’s Journey transformed the way I look at the world

The Hero’s Journey has been a part of my education since the moment I left traditional school.

Back when [Alpha](https://alpha.school/) was held in our principal’s house, he put a poster outlining the Hero’s Journey on the wall of my favorite room (there was no furniture so my friends and I did cartwheels and handstands during breaks):

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vqlC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eb4a591-57e3-41db-9d1e-1e2a2825748f_795x800.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vqlC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eb4a591-57e3-41db-9d1e-1e2a2825748f_795x800.jpeg)

Every book report required that I wrote how that story connected to the Hero’s Journey and the speeches I gave for the afternoon workshops all followed the same format.

It soon trickled into other parts of my life – I would watch movies and TV shows and start to notice the Road of Trials and Return to the Familiar and Having Changed. Even if it didn’t initially seem like it, every good story followed this path. When my dad told stories about the exploits he got up to when he was younger, he – perhaps unknowingly – told them as a Hero’s Journey. My Encyclopedia Brown short stories all had an Ordinary World, Call to Adventure, Allies and Helpers, and so on.

The Hero’s Journey was everywhere.

In sixth grade, I really struggled. The first half of the year, I worked harder than I ever had before (and probably ever will, which sounds weird, I know). I was writing a 10,000 word short story, finishing my weekly spelling bees, giving a TEDTalk and a Hero’s Interview, finishing eighth grade math, selling things on eBay for my dad, and, of course, doing a [college accounting course](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-9-the-accounting-disaster).

Every day felt like a Hero’s Journey Trial – every homework assignment I stayed at school until 6pm to finish, every chapter I wrote in my story, every speech I gave (remember: I was literally 11 years old and had a 9 o’clock bedtime). It all led up to that final exam in accounting – that was my Final Showdown.

I got through each day knowing that I was working towards this accounting final and, once I finished that, I would be on the Long Return Home.

The story I told myself motivated me to keep working and studying.

When the final exam came along, I felt prepared, yet scared, like any protagonist in a children’s novel.

In the end, all of those Trials paid off and I got an A on the final.

After the exam, I let go of all of my crazy study habits and integrated back into the social life at Alpha – but all of the lessons stayed with me. I was a new person – I’d changed.

The best thing, though, about the Hero’s Journey is that it’s cyclical – a few months later, I found myself on a new journey, meeting new allies, completing new trials, and changing again and again.

### Childhood as a hero’s journey (& tricking your kid into becoming a problem-solver)

There’s nothing a child wants more than to be the hero of the story. They grow up hearing of daring rescues, defeating monsters, and dramatic battles, and fantasize about doing those things too.

Compare those stories with the [learned helplessness epidemic](https://www.tiktok.com/@levihawk/video/7411263372185963818?_r=1&_t=8qkV2sO5R8w) in classrooms around the nation, and you’ll find a severe disconnect. Kids are giving up – letting someone else do the hard part and save them.

This is disastrous.

If your kid grows up expecting other people to solve their problems for them, they’ll have a lot more trouble being successful later in life.

So what’s the solution?

Send them on a Hero’s Journey.

Do something similar to what I talked about in my anecdote: tell your kid about the Hero’s Journey and have them identify the particular aspects of the path in movies or TV shows they watch and in books they read. Prove to them the prevalence of the Hero’s Journey.

Then, when they’re struggling with something, discuss how it’s like their own Road of Trials. You can even compare certain situations to scenarios they’re already familiar with!

“Oh, your friend is mad at you? Well, let’s think about how you can move past this Trial – do you remember how Sofia got her two best friends to forgive her in that episode of Sofia the First? Why don’t you try something like that?”

“You don’t understand your science project about the animal kingdom? How did the Octonauts work through their problems with identifying sea creatures? Do you remember any of their creature reports?”

Train your kid to recognize that when they come across a problem they can solve on their own. Whenever possible, ensure that the media they’re consuming (books, shows, movies, etc.) shows them how to go about solving those problems when they arise.

For the other parts of the Hero’s Journey:

* Ordinary World: Before a big change in their life (new school year, moving, gaining a sibling, etc.), talk to them about how they’re feeling about the world and to talk through their favorite things, opinions, and relationships.
* Call to Adventure: If your kid is resistant to change, talk to them about how it’s their Call to Adventure – look at the situation like something new and exciting.
* Entering the Unknown: Talk about how it’s okay to be scared or upset, so long as you push through. Use examples of their favorite heroes.
* Allies/Helpers/Mentors: Talk to them about the role their friends, teachers, teammates, and family members play in their lives – a good thing to talk through if you think your kid is hanging out with someone who isn’t a “good influence.”
* Final Showdown/Long Return Home/Return to the Familiar: Help them get through a big challenge in their life by positioning it as a final showdown. Help them remember why they’re going through this journey (sometimes external rewards help the most).
* Having Changed:  After each challenge, help your kid reset and figure out what they learned from the experience. Do yearly retrospectives and ask your kid how they’ve changed as a person. Start with simple questions (is your favorite color the same?) and work your way up to the bigger ones (what are you passionate about?). You can also do personality tests and other fun things like that to showcase growth over the year.

Show your kid that they can be the hero of their story, not just a bystander in someone else’s.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [Will America Fall Like Rome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTVCgnorJFE)

Despite the busy week I had, I made time for myself to voluntarily watch a ONE HOUR AND FORTY MINUTE LECTURE. If one of my professors assigned a lecture video that long, I would probably find one of those fancy YouTube video to AI summary converters instead of watching it (for legal reasons, that was a joke). But this lecture was so captivating and relevant I watched the whole thing – that’s how good it is. Jonathan Bi beautifully interprets Shakespeare’s *Julius Caesar* and compares the situation of Rome to that of America.

My favorite takeaway of the video is about recognizing within yourself if you’re playing a character – if so, to what extent and how does it affect your life? Bi looks at how both Caesar and Brutus acted out a character or role instead of being their own person, and contrasts it to how Mark Antony’s complete brashness and openness about who he is – and how it helped and hurt all three of them.

You have to ask yourself when playing a role might help you improve, and when it might hurt you – when I’m “playing” Austin Scholar, I’m braver and more assertive, but when I take off my mask, so to speak, I listen and smile and give hugs. I’m softer. Managing that balance between Austin Scholar and regular me is what will help me be successful both professionally and personally.

2. [How to do nothing](https://medium.com/@the_jennitaur/how-to-do-nothing-57e100f59bbb)

Another [COLLEGE 101](https://college.stanford.edu/courses/why-college) reading for y’all!! “How to do nothing” by Jenny Odell particularly stood out to me this week because in today’s “attention economy,” there are always a million things fighting for your attention – TikTok, video games, school work, after school activities, sports, job opportunities, online courses, and so much more. It is genuinely so hard to make time to do nothing. Nothing, in this case, requires quiet observation and being in nature.

A challenge for your family: every day this week, spend ten minutes outside, listening to birds, feeling the grass, admiring the plants, stargazing, and simply being present. I promise: if you take it seriously, you’ll feel so much more at peace.

Also, an important message for your high-achieving high schoolers: “There is nothing to be admired about being constantly connected, constantly potentially productive the second you open your eyes in the morning – and in my opinion, no one should accept this, not now, not ever.” Waking up and immediately checking Instagram, finishing homework, and watching TV is not the way to live a fulfilling life. Be present. Have a relaxing morning routine. Be active. Set boundaries with yourself – yes, you *could* study from 10pm to 2am, but maybe you should go to sleep at 12am instead.

3. [Childhoods of exceptional people](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/childhoods)

Please, please, please spend five minutes reading this article. Karlsson explains how he analyzed the childhoods of truly remarkable thinkers and inventors and identified a list of the most important characteristics – and you’ll find that they seem to *very* closely align with the things I’ve written about.

As Karlsson writes:

The number one characteristic of exceptional childhoods is that “the adults had high expectations of the children.” Which is a lot like: believe that kids are limitless.

“A qualified guess is that [many of history’s famous characters] spent between one and four hours daily in formal studies, and the rest on self-directed projects,” – similar to Alpha’s structure of 2 Hour Learning in the morning and workshops in the afternoon.

“If you [have 1:1 tutoring] for 1-4 hours daily, you can go much deeper earlier, even more so if the child is uncommonly motivated and gifted. This also means more time for free exploration, self-directed learning and developing meaningful relationships.” Online apps allow every student to experience this phenomenon.

“Doing all of this—curating an exceptional milieu, providing dedicated tutoring and opportunities for apprenticeship—is hard work. You could pull it off if you put your mind to it, I trust. Though, like everything pursued to excellence, it would demand serious sacrifices. Particularly of time. It is ok not to want that.

“A lot of it does not require sacrifices, though. It is just a way of viewing children: as capable of competence, as craving meaningful work, as worthy to be included in serious discussions.”

Parenting is a lot of work. You have to put in the time to build a relationship with your kid and help them thrive. But their journey to becoming exceptional all starts with you believing in them, and I hope Austin Scholar has convinced you to do just that.
