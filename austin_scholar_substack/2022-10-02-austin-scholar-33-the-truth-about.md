### **Hey, y'all!**

One of my classmates at Alpha–a school dedicated to top percentile test scores–got a 74% on her Algebra I test last winter.

A few months later, she took the test again and got a 98%.

Her secret for improving her scores? Going back to 5th grade.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. My Interview with My Classmate on How She Improved Her Test Scores
2. My Key Takeaways on Mastery-Based Learning
3. Scholar’s Sources: The Best Resources for Trying Mastery-Based Learning With Your Teen

This week, my best friend P and I tested the Write of Passage: Liftoff curriculum at Alpha, and *wow*, it’s a completely different experience than it was over Zoom.

Having half of the kids (I’ve started calling my friends kids?!) look down, talk when I’m talking, and not answer discussion questions is a lot more nerve-wracking (and frustrating) than a black Zoom box.

I’m not going to lie: I’ve gained a new respect for high school teachers.

### My Interview with My Classmate on How She Improved Her Test Scores

Like I was saying: [Hope Aboel-Nil](https://twitter.com/hope_nil), a junior at Alpha, got a 74% on her Algebra final last winter.

A few months later, she retook the test and got a 98%.

This week, I interviewed her to find out how she completely turned her test scores around. Here's what she told me in our interview (with my questions edited out for ease of reading):

*In middle school, when I went to a traditional school–like in a classroom–I was much more focused on getting through the content and passing tests than actually learning the content.*

*I sort of knew enough of what I was learning to pass tests and get high scores. I was able to get by, do well, and get A's.*

*It was all okay until high school math, when I realized that I didn't remember anything that I had learned in middle school.*

*Math suddenly got a lot harder and a lot less fun.*

*I got stuck in Algebra I for two years because I was literally just staring at problems and doing content that I wasn't ready for.*

*And last winter, when I took my Algebra I final, I got a 74%.*

*After two years of hard work and frustration, I only knew 70% of Algebra I.*

*In response to that grade, my dad told me that there was clearly something I was missing, and I would have to go back to fifth-grade math to figure out what it was.*

*To me, that sounded absolutely ridiculous.*

*Fifth-grade math has nothing to do with Algebra I.*

*But my dad assured me that “math builds on itself” and “if you definitely know fifth-grade math, Algebra would be a lot easier,” and other silly things like that.*

*Do you know how embarrassing that was? Being a sophomore in high school and being forced to do fifth-grade math?*

*I didn’t tell anyone what I was doing because of how mortified I was.*

*But after a lot of anger and bitterness and embarrassment, I agreed to go back and find my math holes, if only to improve my Algebra I grade.*

*And so, my dad put me in learning apps. Because they’re adaptive, I didn’t have to go through an entire grade level. The app adapted to only give me lessons on what I didn’t understand.*

*After two weeks, I got a 100% on a (surprisingly challenging) fifth-grade test, so I moved on to sixth grade.*

*A few weeks later, I got a 100% on a sixth-grade test, and then a 100% on a seventh-grade test.*

*You want to know something crazy? I actually felt myself making progress and filling in the gaps in my math knowledge.*

*Even crazier: I started to actually enjoy math.*

*The best feeling is when you look at a math question and immediately know how to solve it, while the worst feeling is when you have no idea how to solve it.*

*Because I had a deepening understanding of math concepts, I knew how to solve more and more questions.*

*It made me realize that math can actually be fun. I was just sitting home, answering math questions and not hating it.*

*And when I did get back up to doing Algebra, I was able to understand so much more–so much faster.*

*Instead of learning how to multiply exponents while learning how to factor polynomials, I just had to learn the formulas for factoring.*

*And because I had to get a 100% on an Algebra I practice test in an app before I retook the official final exam, I was so incredibly prepared for the official exam.*

*And it showed.*

*When I retook the final, I got a 98%.*

*In just a few months, I went from hating math and scoring in the low seventies to actually enjoying math and getting an A+.*

*That’s the power of mastery learning.*

*A big part of mastery learning that most people don’t understand is that **mastery doesn’t mean you can get a question right, it means that you can’t get it wrong**.*

*Everyone has mastered basic addition.*

*If I asked you what 1 + 1 is, you would always know the answer.*

*That is what mastery is.*

*But actually reaching that level of understanding in any math concept takes time.*

*It takes time and frustration.*

*Sometimes, you’ll have to realize that you never really grasped exponential functions, so you have to go back to fifth grade before you can continue in Algebra II.*

*I think that, in order to master something, you have to be willing to not be embarrassed–because embarrassment will stop you from going back in order to move forward.*

*Overall, I think that enjoyment and success in math comes down to who puts the most effort into mastering the basics. Because math really does build on itself, you will have no chance at understanding the Pythagorean theorem if you haven’t mastered exponents and square roots first.*

*And even though it might seem overwhelming, embarrassing, or pointless to waste hours going back to fifth grade, it will save you so much time.*

*If I added up all of the hours I am now going to spend in math, I know that it will be far less than it would have been if I hadn’t gone back to do the work.*

*Mastering fifth grade math increased my Algebra I grade by 25%.*

*If you allow yourself to feel embarrassed and recognize that going back can only help you, I promise: you can see those kinds of leaps, too.*

### My Takeaways from My Interview with Hope

As someone who has gone back to the basics too, I really resonated with Hope’s story.

My favorite quote from the interview:  “*mastery doesn’t mean you can get a question right, it means that you can’t get it wrong*.”

That is genuinely one of the most powerful statements any kid can hear while going through school. When students just aim to be able to get a question right on a test, they end up missing the underlying principles of the topic and memorizing their way to A’s.

The other key point that Hope covered is that in order to achieve true mastery, kids have to take ownership of their math journey and truly *want* to learn.

They have to want to change their mindset from “I hope I get this question right” to “I know I can’t get this question wrong.”

They have to accept that some parts of the journey might be embarrassing or frustrating and might seem like a waste of time. And they have to understand that mastery can save them hours of frustration and work in the future.

They have to realize that going back can only propel them forward.

### Scholar’s Sources: The Best Resources for Trying Mastery-Based Learning With Your Teen

Khan Academy has an [absolutely incredible video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWa48XRnLh0&t=357s) explaining mastery with a great visual. The video does a great walk-through on why the traditional education system doesn’t support kids enough in the learning journey, and highlights why adaptive apps (such as Khan Academy) fix this problem.[This article](https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/blog/mastery-learning/) is a compression of all of the mastery learning data and experiments out there. The article does a great breakdown of the different major mastery learning studies that have taken place. I highly recommend checking this article out.

If you want to use mastery learning concepts even though your kid is in a traditional school, try using [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) (all grades and subjects) or [Albert](https://www.albert.io/) (high school–focused, advanced courses, and SAT/ACT prep) for supplemental materials. Whenever your kid finds themselves stuck or not doing well on a test, have them go work through the corresponding Khan Academy lesson.

Additionally, they can try out the [gt.school](https://gt.school/) program (the one that Hope used!) where they will have to go back to early math grades and work their way up to mastery.

Yes, it might be extra work now, but as Hope explained, it will save them time in the future.

Finally, if you (or your kid!) want to try out more mastery learning techniques, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsKI7sakE48) has some suggestions on exercises to do and how to break down concepts.
