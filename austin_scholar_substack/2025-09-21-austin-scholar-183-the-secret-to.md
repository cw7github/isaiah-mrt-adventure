### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. The secret to teaching your kid to be an expert
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

I’m headed back to Stanford! Tomorrow is the first day of my sophomore year of college. I changed my life by starting this newsletter in my sophomore year of high school, so I have high hopes my sophomore year of college will bring great things. Next week I’ll be sending out a progress and goals update along with updated goal-setting practices that you can do with your kid, so stay tuned for that!

### The secret to teaching your kid to be an expert

I was scrolling through X the other day and I stumbled across this account called @KutterIsKing. This person posts almost exclusively about Yankees shortstop Anthony Volpe – and his posts are exclusively *negative*. He knows his poor batting average against left-handed pitchers on Tuesday nights. He can tell you exactly how many double plays he's botched in the bottom of the seventh inning in last night’s game. He has graphics comparing his errors to every other shortstop in MLB history.

KutterIsKing probably knows more about Anthony Volpe than Volpe's own mother.

This guy accidentally became a certifiable expert through the pure, unbridled power of being a hater.

Here's the thing – and stay with me here – sometimes the most powerful motivator for deep learning isn't love or curiosity. Sometimes it's the burning desire to prove someone wrong. Sometimes it's the need to win an argument so badly that you'll research every possible angle, memorize every statistic, and analyze every piece of evidence.

Is this the most wholesome approach to learning? Absolutely not.

Is it wildly effective with kids who are naturally competitive or contrarian? You bet it is.

Being an expert is something I've talked about a lot in this newsletter, and for good reason. It's absolutely critical for success – knowing how to develop deep knowledge allows you to have insights and ideas no one else does. It's what separates the top 1% from everyone else.

But here's the thing: the last few times I've written about expertise development, I realized the exercises weren't as accessible to younger kids. They aren't going to create BrainLifts or truly understand the Depth of Knowledge frameworks.

They need something more immediately engaging. Something that taps into their natural energy and motivation.

Enter: being a hater.

Before you start worrying that I'm encouraging your kid to become a negative, argumentative person, let me explain the learning science here. David Yeager's research in "10 to 25" shows that young people are neurobiologically wired to crave socially rewarding experiences – particularly the feeling of being right, being respected, and having their voice heard.

What we traditionally call "being a hater" can turn into one of the most powerful drivers of deep learning. When you care enough about something to argue against it, you're naturally motivated to:

* Gather comprehensive evidence
* Understand complex systems and relationships
* Analyze patterns and make connections
* Create novel frameworks and solutions

The key is channeling that argumentative energy productively.

Here's how this works as a family activity that's actually fun and educational:

**Step 1: Pick Your Target**

Have your kid choose someone or something they genuinely dislike or disagree with. This could be:

* A particular athlete or sports team
* A TV character (preferably from a show with lots of episodes)
* A book villain
* A YouTuber they find annoying
* Team Cap vs Team Iron Man debates
* Conrad vs Jeremiah (if you know, you know)

The key is picking something they have STRONG feelings about.

**Step 2: The Challenge**

Tell them you completely disagree with their position. You're going to challenge them to a massive debate at the end of the weekend, and whoever wins gets to pick dessert for the rest of the week.

Now they're invested.

**Step 3: The DOK Progression**

Depth of Knowledge (DOK) is the framework we use at Alpha to gain mastery of a topic. It's a structure to help kids understand the four stages of mastering a topic: gathering basic facts, mastering a topic's skills and concepts, strategic thinking (synthesizing your knowledge about the topic), and extended thinking (coming up with your own original ideas about the topic). This progression is also the perfect framework for winning a family challenge game.

**Round 1 - (DOK stages 1 & 2): The Knowledge Gathering Challenge** Both of you spend time researching everything about your chosen topic. Read articles, watch videos, gather statistics, and learn the history. Then quiz each other with rapid-fire questions about basic facts and concepts.

Sample questions if you picked Anthony Volpe (and whether he’s a good baseball player or not):

* What's his batting average this season?
* Where did he play college baseball?
* What position did he play in the minors?
* How many home runs did he hit in his rookie season?
* What's his defensive rating compared to other shortstops?

Every wrong answer gives the other person a point (for asking a question the other person didn’t know the answer to). Most points wins this round.

**Round 2 - (DOK stage 3): The Strategic Debate**

Now you argue the broader implications. This isn't about stated facts anymore – it's about analysis, interpretation, and connecting ideas. You need an impartial judge (another family member or friend) to determine the winner.

For our Anthony Volpe example, you might explore:

* How does his performance compare to other rookie shortstops historically?
* What does his development trajectory suggest about his long-term potential?
* How do his advanced metrics compare to traditional stats?
* What role does he play in the team's overall strategy?

**Round 3 - (DOK stage 4): The Expert Synthesis**

Craft a presentation or a speech explaining your core learnings from this person or topic and how it can be applied to different situations. This is a great way to practice your presentation skills, but you can also do other mediums: a short video, a poster, or an essay.

For Anthony Volpe, this could be:

* How rookie development in baseball applies to learning new skills in other areas
* What his journey from college to pros teaches about handling pressure and expectations
* How advanced analytics are changing how we evaluate performance in all fields

You’ll end up with the beginnings of a Spiky POV by the end of this round, whether that’s the goal or not. Here’s an example (I don’t actually know that much about Anthony Volpe, so I’m not sure if this is true, but you can simply use it as a guideline): Anthony Volpe’s rookie year explains why you should treat learning any new skill the way the MLB treats rookie development.

You’ll have another judge for this round to decide whose presentation had the better takeaways, and the person with the most points wins the entire competition!

Let me walk you through how this works through a hypothetical 3rd grader who we’ll call Emma, who was absolutely convinced that Captain Marvel was the worst addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

**DOK 1-2 Round:** Emma spent hours researching Captain Marvel's comic book history, her movie's box office performance, critical reviews, and her role in the larger MCU timeline. Let’s say that her mom argued the opposite position, so she had to learn all the same information. By the end, both Emma and her mom could tell you Captain Marvel's publication history dating back to 1967, her various incarnations, and detailed plot points from every appearance.

**DOK 3 Round:** They debated whether Captain Marvel's character development was rushed compared to other MCU heroes, how her power level affects narrative tension, and whether her movie successfully integrated into the existing storyline. Emma made sophisticated arguments about character arcs and storytelling structure.

**DOK 4 Round:** Emma created a video essay explaining how Captain Marvel's introduction illustrates the challenges of adding overpowered characters to established universes – and connected it to similar problems in other franchises like Superman in DC movies, and even how these problems show up in video game universes. She ended with a [Spiky POV](https://www.weskao.com/blog/spiky-point-of-view-lets-get-a-little-controversial) that Captain Marvel’s critical reception is indicative of poor storytelling in superhero movies. The problem isn’t “overpowered characters”, it’s underpowered storytellers.

She'd become a genuine expert in narrative structure, character development, and franchise management. All because she wanted to prove Captain Marvel sucked.

Here's the beautiful thing – as kids grow up, you can continue this exercise with increasingly sophisticated topics:

**Elementary school:** Pokémon type matchups, favorite cartoon characters, sports teams

**Middle school:** Book series, movie franchises, social media platforms, music artists**High school:** Political positions, educational systems, technology platforms, social issues

**College and beyond:** Economic policies, philosophical frameworks, research methodologies

The process remains the same, but the complexity deepens. A high schooler who starts by hating on a TikTok creator might end up with genuine expertise in digital media psychology, attention economics, and social platform design.

Traditional learning often feels arbitrary to kids. Why do I need to know about the Revolutionary War? Why does photosynthesis matter? When will I use algebra?

But when you're trying to win an argument, every piece of information feels immediately relevant. You're not learning "just because" – you're learning to be RIGHT. And being right feels amazing.

This approach also naturally develops what Alpha School calls "intrinsic motivation." Students aren't learning because they have to, but because they genuinely want to understand the topic better than anyone else. That's the difference between memorizing facts for a test and developing real expertise.

The "hater" framework also teaches critical thinking skills that transfer to everything else. When you're systematically building a case against something, you learn to:

* Evaluate sources and evidence quality
* Identify logical fallacies and weak arguments
* Consider multiple perspectives (even if you disagree)
* Distinguish between facts and opinions
* Construct persuasive, evidence-based arguments

These are the exact skills that separate high achievers from everyone else.

**Tips for parents:**

Make sure you participate**.** The first time you do this, get involved yourself. Take the opposite position seriously and do your own research. This shows your kid that the exercise is important enough for you to invest real time and energy.

Adjust the stakes. Picking dessert for a week works for some families. Others might prefer choosing the next movie night film, planning a weekend activity, or earning extra screen time. Find something your kid actually cares about.

Celebrate the process, not just winning. The goal isn't just to win debates – it's to develop genuine expertise. Praise thorough research, creative connections, and sophisticated analysis regardless of who "wins" each round.

Connect to broader applications. Help your kid see how the skills they're developing transfer to school projects, future career success, and life decisions. The research abilities, critical thinking, and communication skills they're building are incredibly valuable.

By the time your kid has done this exercise a few times with different topics, you'll have sneakily taught them the fundamental structure of expertise development. They'll understand that becoming an expert requires:

1. **Comprehensive factual knowledge** (you can't argue effectively without knowing the basic information)
2. **Conceptual understanding** (you need to understand how systems work, not just memorize facts)
3. **Strategic analysis** (making connections and identifying patterns others miss)
4. **Original synthesis** (creating new frameworks or solutions)

As they grow up, you can continue encouraging them to improve the sophistication of their arguments and the complexity of topics they tackle. The kid who started by hating Barney might end up with genuine expertise in child psychology, educational methodology, or media production.

And there you have it – how to turn your kid into an expert by being a hater. It's not the most conventional advice, but it works. Sometimes the best learning happens when we're passionate enough to prove someone wrong.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

This week features an exclusive investing source because I recently got a DM from one of my subscribers featuring a 2,500-word Google Doc with investing recommendations and thoughts, which genuinely made me so happy. I’m so grateful that y’all are keeping up with and caring about this journey of mine. In the spirit of that document, here’s my favorite of the investing books I’ve read in the past two weeks that have stuck with me (and that I think you’ll find interesting).

1. [You Can Be a Stock Market Genius](https://www.amazon.com/You-Can-Stock-Market-Genius/dp/0684840073)

*You Can Be a Stock Market Genius* by Joel Greenblatt is a guide for individual investors to exploit special market situations, especially spinoffs, restructurings, and other corporate transactions that often lead to hidden value. The book explains both how and why these opportunities arise and offers actionable strategies to profit from them. As someone who’s been trying to find her investing niche, I found this book extremely interesting. Spinoffs in particular intrigued me, as Greenblatt outlined extremely clear circumstances for when to invest and when not to. Greenblatt explains that spinoffs (where a parent company separates a division into a new independent entity) tend to outperform the market due to indiscriminate selling, misaligned investor interest, and newly unleashed managerial incentives. There are also a lot of studies that support the overperformance of spinoffs:

* Spinoffs typically exceed the S&P 500 by 11–13% in the first 12–18 months post-spin.
* The Bloomberg U.S. Spin-off Index has dramatically surpassed the S&P 500 over multi-year periods.
* Value investors like Seth Klarman and Charlie Munger also endorse the strategy, highlighting its persistent effectiveness.

Greenblatt-inspired research tracks new spinoff announcements and schedules. As of now, pending spinoffs include divisions of Sony, Well Health, Maple Leaf Foods, Unilever, Spectrum Brands, Topgolf Callaway Brands, Honeywell, Comcast, Aptiv, and others, with target dates spanning late 2025 through 2026. These companies are key candidates for deeper analysis using Greenblatt’s criteria, particularly focusing on management incentives, parent/spinoff post-transaction structures, and anticipated indiscriminate selling.
