### **Hey, y'all!**

Harry Potter is one of my favorite book series. I've devoured all seven books (many times), read countless hours of fanfiction, and am a proud Potterhead.

But there's something really special about this series beyond its entertainment value.

The Harry Potter books were almost literally magic. They've helped kids make friends, combated loneliness, turned a whole generation into readers, and impacted millions of lives.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How Harry Potter made a lasting impact on me
2. The real-life magic of the Harry Potter series (and why your kid needs more of it)
3. Scholar’s Sources: My favorite magical reading recommendations

This is the final newsletter you’ll be getting while I’m at my writing class at Oxford. I’m so excited to tell y’all about my experience here next week!

### Austin’s Anecdote: How Harry Potter Made A Lasting Impact On Me

From the moment I first read about eleven-year-old Harry Potter walking through Diagon Alley, I was completely entranced.

It felt like I, too, was experiencing magic for the first time.

Throughout the entire series, I felt like I was building such a strong connection with these made-up characters.

I *loved* Hermione Granger and firmly believed that she was the only reason that Harry stayed alive.

I adored the Marauders and was hurt by Peter’s betrayal and the deaths of Sirius and Remus.

I was completely offended by Snape when he killed Dumbledore. Like, I was seriously so mad.

And, I really, *really* wished that I could learn magic, and was heartbroken (but resigned) when I didn’t get a letter on my eleventh birthday.

With Harry Potter, I learned the true power of words. Any emotion can be evoked by compelling phrasing. People can become friends with words on a page.

It was simply life-changing.

And yes, now, as I’ve spent hundreds of hours analyzing every piece of the so-called Potterverse, I can recognize the plot holes and have come up with millions of other ways that the books could have gone. (Like, why didn’t Dumbledore or Harry tell everyone that Voldemort was a half-blood? All of the blood-purists worshipped him and thought that he was the most powerful wizard, so if they found out he was only a half-blood all of their “pureblood is superior to all” beliefs would be completely thrown off.)

But, the absolute magic of the books themselves cannot be denied.

So, this newsletter is basically my love letter to Harry Potter and how it changed millions of lives (and why books like this are so important for your teen’s development).

### The Real-Life Magic Of The Harry Potter Series (And Why Your Kid Needs More Of It)

Okay, so: the Harry Potter books themselves are beautiful and absolutely transformative.

10/10, love them.

But, in my opinion, the most magical part of Harry Potter is what grew from it.

The Harry Potter fandom has taken the core brilliance of Harry Potter and transfigured it into an entire universe.

And it comes down to, as it did in the series itself, the *houses*.

Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff are arguably one of the most iconic aspects of the series.

A common “get-to-know-you” question is literally, “What Harry Potter house are you in?”

Thousands of Instagram bios have “hufflepuff pride!! \*sparkle emoji\*” or “i’m a slytherin.”

Obviously, in the series, the house rivalry is a pretty continuous storyline, but why were the houses themselves the part that stuck out the most?

Well, I believe that it comes down to the fact that the houses could transcend the magical world and in doing so, connect millions and millions of people together, simply by the colors of their Harry Potter merch.

The brilliant thing about the houses is that each house is defined by personality traits and values, not the existence of magic.

Anyone can say that they’re a Gryffindor if they are brave and chivalrous, a Slytherin if they are ambitious and cunning, a Ravenclaw if they’re knowledgable and witty, or a Hufflepuff if they’re hard-working and loyal.

And by identifying with a house, they can feel just a bit closer to the world of magic.

When I took the [Pottermore test](https://www.wizardingworld.com/) and waited in anticipation to be sorted, I felt as if I was eleven years old, sitting on the wooden stool waiting for the Sorting Hat to call out a house for me.

And when I got Hufflepuff (my hard-working nature shining through, folks), I was ready to get my yellow and black sweatshirt and wave my magic wand.

It’s like I was told, “Yer a wizard, Austin,” just as Harry was.

It’s that connection that you get from being in one of the infamous houses to the world of Harry Potter that makes them so valuable.

And not only that, but the houses have also allowed people to form connections with each other.

“Oh, you’re a Slytherin? Me too!” Instant friendship.

It’s incredible.

This connection to both the Harry Potter world and the people around us has allowed millions of people to feel a deep sense of belonging.

“Ravenclaws like to read and solve riddles? So do I, so I can be a wizard, too!”

“Gryffindors like to take risks and be a little reckless? That’s me, so I can save the Wizarding World, just like Harry.”

These Harry Potter houses have allowed an entire generation to feel like they belong. Like they are important and valuable. Like they can do magic.

But why does this matter?

Well, this is simply one of the most remarkable things to use to explain the power of words.

Seven coming-of-age books with four random houses allowed millions of people to connect with each other and feel like they, too, can be a hero.

Reading fiction can be just as valuable as non-fiction. Sometimes it’s a novel about wizards that impacts kids’ lives the most.

Don’t forget to include a healthy serving of magic in your literary diet.

Take a break from professional, dry articles and read something *magical*.

Encourage your teen to take time this summer to welcome dazzling, alluring words into their daily lives and experience that wonder.

It will likely make them want to read more (which is always a win), and it will also teach them lessons that all of the boring academic books in the world can’t touch.

### Scholar’s Sources: My Favorite Magical Reading Recommendations

Here are a few poems, books, and other random pieces that made me believe in the power of words.

[The Disappearances](https://www.amazon.com/Disappearances-Emily-Bain-Murphy/dp/0544879368) by Emily Bain Murphy

This book is simply mystical. It’s one of those “I, the dramatic main character, suffered a tragedy so now I have to move to a town that must be hiding a secret” books, but it is done so remarkably well.

The prose is flowy and mysterious, yet told through the perspective of a relatable narrator. The supernatural elements add just the right amount of drama. I just… have no words to describe how stunning this book is and how much I wish I could read it again as if it were the first time.

[The Night Circus](https://www.amazon.com/Night-Circus-Erin-Morgenstern/dp/0307744434) by Erin Morgenstern

This is genuinely the most magical book I have ever read. It is truly transcendent. Both of the main characters are wonderful and beautiful and the plot is absolutely entrancing. Honestly, even when I was a little confused as to what magic was occurring, I did not care because the descriptions and prose were so incredible.

[The Fish](https://poets.org/poem/fish-2) by Elizabeth Bishop

I chose this poem to analyze for my English class because I panicked and remembered hearing about it before. But–wow–what a lovely accident.

This poem is gripping and strong and has layers upon layers of meaning. I had pretty much the most fun I’ve ever had on an English assignment when I was writing this essay. I adored dissecting every sentence and picking apart the word choice.

[Dandelion](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwik8YOi7Pz4AhWME9QBHUd2CywYABAJGgJvYQ&sig=AOD64_02G03IYmMhD9aztLyt_2ICLT0LKA&ctype=5&q=&ved=2ahUKEwiihPqh7Pz4AhV3kWoFHbQcAjsQ9aACKAB6BAgCEEM&adurl=) by Gabbi Hannah

This is the poetry book that got me into poetry. I read it during my journey of mental health recovery, and I have never felt so seen in a piece of writing. Every heartbreaking emotion and thought that I had was laid out in black and white. Because of these poems, I felt a little less alone.

[Mind Mine](https://mindmine.substack.com/) on Substack

I met Isabel, the author of the Mind Mine newsletter, during one of the Write of Passage Cohort-7 Live Sessions, and we instantly delved into a rant about women empowerment. That was easily the best breakout room I’ve ever been a part of. And so, when Isabel told me she was beginning her newsletter, I immediately subscribed.

I am so glad that I did. Every Mind Mine newsletter is a beautifully-written, story-infused, incredibly insightful piece that I so love to read. The [“on processing the passage of time”](https://mindmine.substack.com/p/time?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) newsletter is one of my absolute favorites.
