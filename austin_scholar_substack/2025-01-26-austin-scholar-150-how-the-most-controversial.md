### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. How the most controversial educator created the best school in the UK (& what you can learn from her)
2. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

My sister came to Stanford to visit me this past weekend! I know it’s only been a few weeks since Christmas break, but I was already missing her so much. I feel so at peace and genuinely happy when I’m with her, so her visit has definitely fueled me for these upcoming midterm weeks.

### How the most controversial educator created the best school in the UK

I first found out about Katharine Birbalsingh, Headmistress of the Michaela School, from [this video](https://x.com/miss_snuffy/status/1879776266670469274?s=58&t=169ycRyM0JQ0yBsBdWsEPA). A majority of her claims are shocking – completely contradictory to modern parenting and educational thought.

But her school has the [best academic results in the UK](https://michaela.education/). A school that started in 2014 is now beating out all of the venerated hundred-year-old institutions. She *must* be doing something right.

What, though? Well, she attributes this success to the fact that motivation in education is just as important as the content students are learning.

This is, surprisingly, part of what makes her controversial. So many modern educational theorists (myself included) have talked about the importance of having a “why” – a reason for learning and improving that goes beyond oneself so that education becomes a lifestyle, not just a requirement.

Birbalsingh recognizes that your “higher purpose” is a part of your education, but believes that it comes much later. Purpose only comes after the attainment of other, more immediately motivating goals:

* Level 1: **Avoid Demerits/Detentions**: At the foundational level, students are motivated by a desire to avoid negative consequences. They follow rules and complete assignments primarily to avoid punishment.

* Level 2: **Earn Merits/Rewards**: Students begin to see the value in positive reinforcement. They strive to earn merits and rewards, shifting their focus from avoiding punishment to achieving recognition.

* Level 3: **Impress Teachers**: Students develop a desire to gain the approval and respect of their teachers. They view their teachers as role models and strive to meet their expectations.

* Level 4: **A Great Future/Self-Development**: Students begin to connect their present actions with their future aspirations. They understand that developing good habits and working hard will contribute to a successful future. They take ownership of their learning and development.

* Level 5: **It's Who You Are**: At the pinnacle, desired behaviors and values become integrated into the student's identity. They are no longer driven by external rewards or punishments but act according to their internalized values and character. They \*are\* the kind of person who is diligent, respectful, and strives for excellence.

Here is a visualization of Birbalsingh’s pyramid of student motivation (courtesy of [Poe](https://poe.com/)):

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2tGX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18237115-ae69-4918-bf68-802bbeeb11ca_1600x1158.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2tGX!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18237115-ae69-4918-bf68-802bbeeb11ca_1600x1158.png)

I’m a rule-follower and lover of structure, so this pyramid makes sense to me – the step-by-step process and clear stages make it easy to identify where I am and what I’m working towards. My sister, on the other hand, would look at this pyramid and scoff. She’s much more free-spirited than I am and prefers to work and learn on her own terms.

Now, I’m always looking for new and innovative educational ideas, but I must admit that this path seems antithetical to much of the rhetoric out there (even by Jordan Peterson and Elon Musk). But for any rule following kids, I can see how this is helpful.

It’s easy for those students to get stuck in stages 1-3 – to follow rules and strive to impress their mentors and teachers, yet fail to go beyond conforming; they don’t reach those final stages and become their own person. They’ve followed the rules and avoided punishments for their entire life, yet have never found a true passion or purpose. This pyramid structure allows them to move past that extrinsically motivated hamster wheel and figure out what kind of person they want to become.

However, if a rule-following kid was placed from the onset in stages 4 or 5, they would probably be lost and overwhelmed by the lack of structure and feel they don’t have the skills or habits to succeed. The bottom-up structure of the pyramid helps scaffold their development by teaching them how to perform well, and then slowly letting them go on their own.

With this model, I can 100% understand how certain students thrive in their academics and development.

But I don’t think it’s for everyone. My sister, for example, would be stuck on step one forever – she needs to feel as though she has a purpose first. Things like demerits, detentions, and impressing teachers don’t matter to her.

Last year, she bragged about how she was #1 in the school in both detentions and academic performance.

Her story proves that not every successful student is motivated by Birbalsingh’s Pyramid – you have to recognize what works best for your kid.

If you *do* have a rule-following, academically-focused kid (like me) who you want to help become the best version of themself, you can use Birbalsingh’s Pyramid to help motivate them. Here are exercise ideas built around each step in the pyramid:

1. Avoid demerits by using a Rule Reflection and Habit Tracker

The goal of this exercise is to help students recognize the importance of rules and track their adherence to them.

Start by listing 3-5 key rules that apply to your home (e.g. 30 minutes/day in online apps after school, reading 30 pages before going to sleep, completing homework on time) and then using a habit tracker to record whether they’ve followed these rules each day. If they miss a day, they get some sort of punishment (e.g. no screen time on Saturday, earlier bedtime). At the end of the week, talk through what they did, what they didn’t do, and how they can improve next week.

2. Earn merits by Creating a Rewards System

This exercise should encourage students to set small goals and work toward rewards.

After they’ve gone a month without missing a day on their tracker, change the demerits to merits. Assign points to each task (e.g. 30 minutes of app time/day = 3 points), then set up a “menu” of rewards they can buy with their points (e.g. 60 points = no screen time limits for the weekend, 20 points = extra dessert). If you want to, you can have big rewards for your kid to work towards instead of smaller ones (e.g. concert tickets = 300 points).

3. Impress parents by receiving feedback

With this exercise, you encourage your kids to not only learn to receive feedback, but also to work towards impressing you.

At the beginning of every week, sit down with your kid and talk to them about one thing you want them to work on (e.g. mastering multiplication tables, reading a book, using the correct grammar in sentences). Then, at the end of the week, talk through your perspective on their progress and explain to them ways they could’ve done better and what they did well.

Later on, they can also start to give you feedback – did they way you said something make them feel like you don’t care about them? Did you have conversations about things other than school together? Learning to give feedback is just as important as learning to receive feedback.

4. Look toward their future

Once they’ve gotten through these first few stages and have become adept at building habits and motivating themselves through external means, it’s time to find that internal motivation.

This is the stage where you have your kid complete the [Values Pie Chart exercise](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-46-how-to-set-your), [Ikigai exercises](https://positivepsychology.com/ikigai-worksheets-templates/), and general [vision boarding](https://www.elizabethrider.com/how-to-make-a-vision-board-that-works/).

Help your kid recognize the things they value and want to work towards and show them how to spend time on those things. Set goals and portion time according to these values.

5. It’s who they are

Once your kid reaches this level, it’s time to realize that instead of an enforcer, your role should be that of a mentor, a partner. You no longer need to dole out consequences for your kid not doing their homework, you know they’re going to do it.

This is such a joyous part of your relationship with them – your kid is able to meet you where you are and can interact with you without worry of punishment or needing to impress you.

It should be the goal of every parent, regardless of whether they have a rule-following kid or a free-spirited one, to reach this level.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…

1. [How to be resilient through hardship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwxrXNafK0)

I watched both Gladiator movies over break, so when I saw that Johnathan Bi posted a video about Marcus Aurelius’ stoicism, I had to check it out.

This was one of my favorite lines: “it's the movement towards the good, it's the motion of your life of trying to bring about a better world, that is what generates meaning and happiness.” It goes back to this notion that you give every day everything you have – even if on some days you only have 50% of your peak capacity. As long as you’re doing your best, that’s what matters. That’s what you should be proud of.

I also enjoyed the sections on the values of journaling: “We must not forget that this book right here is his journal, right? It's another Stoic self-therapy, it's another Stoic technique and as such, it describes not who Marcus was but who Marcus fought incessantly to become.” As one of my goals for this year was to journal consistently, I love this framing. This past week, I journaled about the habits I wanted to form and the thoughts I wanted to have – basically pretending I was this idealized version of myself. I found that I was then able to feel more motivated to do these things (workout, wake up earlier, stop scrolling on TikTok, etc.) because I’ve written about it every night.

2. [Move with Nicole at-home pilates](https://www.youtube.com/c/MoveWithNicole)

Going to the gym scares me. I know that’s such a girl thing to say, but there are just so many people there and I don’t really know what I’m doing. But that doesn’t mean I don’t want to work out – rather, I just have to find ways to remove the friction. To this end, I bought a workout mat on Amazon and have been doing at-home pilates workouts three times per week since the quarter started. I feel stronger and more confident in myself and know I’m being kind to my body. So, if you’re someone (or your kid is) who doesn’t like going to the gym, you can’t let that stop you from being active. Try out the Move with Nicole series (or anything similar) and remove the friction from your workout routine.

3. [The case for memorization](https://x.com/david_perell/status/1877175684348408110)

With the increased prevalence of AI, people are beginning to wonder “why should I actually know things? I can just ask ChatGPT.” But unfortunately, for you to be successful, you must memorize and know facts.

Why? As David Perell says, “memorization is necessary for clear thinking.”

He explains how “in theory, you could look up anything online. But in practice, speed matters. You can only move fast when you know things off the top of your head. Experts are useful to consult because they’re fluent in their topic, which is why they can make connections so quickly.”

Think of it this way: genius mathematicians are only able to solve complex problems so fast because they don’t spend their time or cognitive load on their multiplication tables or even basic derivatives. They can only create and invent because they have a [strong baseline](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-137-why-math-fact) – and that’s true for every field. Memorization is still necessary.
