### **Hey, y'all!**

Goal setting for the New Year can be hard and overwhelming–especially for teenagers.

But it doesn’t have to be.

My dad has helped me create the best goal-setting exercises that have set me up to crush 2023.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

3. Scholar’s Sources: The Top Three 2023 Goal-Setting Sources

I’m back! I had an absolutely incredible Christmas break. I did an insane deep clean of my room, bathroom, and closet (in which I got rid of over 10 trash bags of stuff), ate waffles my Mimi made on Christmas morning, and watched way too many Hallmark movies.

School has started again, though, so it’s time to get back to work.

### Austin’s Anecdote: My 2022 Wrapped

2022 was an absolutely life-changing year.

But, let me tell you: it didn't start off that way. The very first week of 2022, I tested positive for COVID, was quarantined, and got dumped by my long-distance girlfriend (she wasn't in a good place in her life for a relationship anymore).

Yeah, it was a rough start.

I cried in my bedroom, alone, with no hope for the coming year.

But I didn’t want to be miserable in 2022. I wanted to have a great year. A year that I would be proud of.

So, I wiped my tears and started the year during the second week of January.

And, honestly, my motivation and momentum really paid off.

In 2022, I was able to...

* Launch Austin Scholar on March 2nd
* Get de-platformed from Substack for being too young
* Re-launch Austin Scholar on March 30th (my birthday)
* Publish my newsletter every week
* Get my first 1,000 Twitter followers
* Do a summer internship with [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/)
* Help launch [Write of Passage: Liftoff](https://liftoff.school/)
* Finish Calculus BC
* Get a 5 on AP Language & Composition
* Go to [Oxford for two weeks](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-26-three-ways-to-get)

I achieved such powerful things in every aspect of my life–though it wasn't easy. At all.

I put in so much work this year. I was at school many nights until 8:00 pm working through my academic apps and writing newsletters and tweeting.

I faced my fears of promoting my work online and DM'd a bunch of Twitter writers that I looked up to.

I put in the hours. I proved to myself that I can, in fact, accomplish something if I really do my best. That my effort does pay off.

I am so proud of myself for what I did in 2022.

2023, though, is a fresh start. I want to use the momentum I have from last year to launch myself to greater heights than I would have thought possible.

So, on December 31st, I asked myself what I really wanted to do this year. What I wanted to pour my heart and soul into achieving. What would add meaning to my life.

In 2023, I am going to...

* Reach 100,000 Twitter followers
* Get 5,000 paid Austin Scholar subscribers
* Get a 1520+ SAT score
* Apply to college

These are all insanely challenging goals. I'm not totally sure, yet, how I'm going to achieve them, but I know I will put in the time and energy to do it.

2022's got nothing on 2023.

### How To Set Your Kids Up For Success In 2023

There are thousands of articles, Twitter threads, and motivational speeches with different exercises and goal-setting techniques to help you prepare for the coming year.

As a teenager, this stuff is super overwhelming. When I'm alone with my thoughts, a year seems like an insurmountable amount of time–time that's hard to prepare for.

But, for the past five years, my dad has helped me set my New Years' Resolutions.

He's asked me fantastic questions and offered me the support I would need to achieve my goals. Every January 1st, my sister and I would sit in my dad's office drawing out our goals on his whiteboard.

After years of setting New Years' goals with my dad, I’m going to share the most helpful strategies I’ve learned, so you can help your kids set theirs.

To start off, your kid will have to spend time reviewing the past year. They have to understand their successes, failures, and capabilities in order to properly plan for the coming year.

Talk through these five "Year in Review" questions with your kid:

1. What one thing am I the proudest of accomplishing in 2022?
2. What are some things in my life that "one-year ago me" wouldn't believe?
3. What is the one thing that most dramatically improved my life?
4. Did I achieve the things I wanted to this year? Why or why not?
5. As a whole, did I spend my time this year in a way that aligns with my values?

These five questions will help your kid evaluate the past year in multiple dimensions: material achievements, personal pride, and time versus value.

The first four are pretty straightforward, but what if your kid doesn't necessarily know what they value?

If they don’t, have them try the [Values Pie Chart Exercise](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-9-the-accounting-disaster).

Creating a Values Pie Chart can help your kid understand and prioritize the different aspects of their life that matter most to them.

Have them start by identifying four to six aspects of their life that are important to them, such as spending time with loved ones, pursuing passions, staying active, and academic achievements.

Then, have them assign a percentage to each aspect to show how much value it holds in their life. The larger the percentage, the most significant that aspect is.

Then, have them draw out their pie chart.

Here's my 2022 Values Pie Chart:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TyCI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66ce1e45-26f6-42ca-8e05-9cfb10567cfe_1380x478.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TyCI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66ce1e45-26f6-42ca-8e05-9cfb10567cfe_1380x478.png)

This exercise can help show your kid that their life is multi-dimensional. That they find value in both spending time with loved ones AND getting good grades.

Aside from helping with their goal setting, this pie chart serves as a great comparative tool for your kid. Comparing the year-to-year charts can really show your kid how they've changed.

For me, I've realized that my 2023 pie chart has a much larger emphasis on preparing myself for the future (college) than my 2022 pie chart did. Because of this, I set more goals around the projects and assignments that would help me build the future I want.

Now that your kid has a pretty comprehensive view on the past year, ask them these two questions:

1. If you had to pick one thing that’s missing from your life, what would it be?
2. How can you make more time for yourself, your relationships, and joy this next year?

These questions also help highlight what’s important to set as a goal.

Let's be real: most people set too many goals at the start of a new year.

I mean, how can you expect yourself to go to the gym twice, drink two gallons of green juice, read for one-hundred and thirty-seven minutes, and do two pages of journaling all in the same day?

This "goal overload" makes each individual goal less important and harder to achieve.

That's why the key to your kid being successful is actually setting *fewer* goals–ideally one challenging goal in each area of life most important to them (Hint: their pie slices).

Ask them this: What is the one thing that, if you do this year, will make you proud of your 2023?

Asking the question in this way shifts the focus of their thoughts away from grades and menial daily tasks and towards something that they have an emotional stake in. They *want* this. This is something that they are willing to put their heart and soul into getting.

This question centers their goals around their personal values and desires.

And if your kid creates that type of goal for each of the pie slices, they will be setting themselves up for a year that truly adds meaning to their life.

(Another hint: make sure the goals are proportional to the percentage of pie each goal is aligned to.)

Finally, how can you help your kid make sure they keep up with their goals?

Help them create systems while their motivation is still there.

Everyone can go to the gym for the first week. But what about the second week? How do you continue going to the gym?

Accountability. Get a gym partner. Share their goals with friends. Create incentives. Find some way to ensure that you will *have* to keep up with your goal.

*Well, my gym buddy is going to the gym today, so I guess I will, too.*

Help your kid figure out what their "gym buddy" is. Help them to use the energy while they have it to set themselves up for success.
