### **Hey, y'all!**

My sister is a volleyball star, but this is a new development–two years ago she wasn't playing volleyball at all.

Her meteoric rise to aptitude–and success–carries some important lessons on how to educate your kid.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How my sister went from novice to best-in-town in under 2 years
2. How to constructively “follow your passion”
3. Scholar’s Sources: My favorite resources on finding a purpose

Unfortunately, despite all of my new systems (which I talked about in my [last newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-31-benjamin-bloom)), this was another anxiety-filled week.

Honestly, it was a good reminder that there isn’t always a clear reason why anxiety sets in.

Sometimes, it’s just a hard week.

Regardless, I’ve been [posting every single day on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AustinScholar), so y’all might want to check it out if you haven’t already! :)

Also, writing this week’s Anecdote was super fun because I love to brag on my sister. She’s awesome, and I can’t wait to tell you all about her.

### Austin’s Anecdote: How My Sister Went From Novice To Best-In-Town In Under 2 Years

My sister didn't touch a volleyball until seventh grade.

This might seem insignificant–except for the fact that now, in ninth grade, she’s on the top travel team in Austin.

How did she master the sport so quickly?

At the beginning of seventh grade, my sister’s life was consumed with one core thing: anime.

And one of the most popular anime on Netflix is a volleyball-themed anime called [Haikyuu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haikyu!!).

After she watched the first episode about the short, volleyball-obsessed boy's journey to win volleyball nationals, she was hooked.

Days were spent locked in her room, watching Haikyuu and learning everything about volleyball. (Watching Haikyuu is actually a great way to become an expert in playing volleyball, surprisingly enough.)

And then came the next step: convincing the family of her new dream to be the best volleyball player in Austin.

Now, my sister had tried *many* different sports in her short 12 years of life that she swore were going to be "the sport."

After watching the Nutcracker, she promised that she would dance in the show.

Simone Biles and the [American Girl Doll: McKenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Girl:_McKenna_Shoots_for_the_Stars) movie led her to declare she wanted to do a backflip.

Then came lyrical dance, basketball, ballet again, tennis, swimming, and an incredible one week on a soccer team.

This, of course, isn't a bad thing. In fact, trying out a ton of different hobbies is actually super important.

It just led to our parents (and me, to be honest) not being super convinced that volleyball was going to last.

And so, imagine our surprise when, after a month, she was *still doing volleyball lessons*.

Not only was she still doing volleyball lessons, she asked to do more volleyball lessons every week.

Over the course of her seventh-grade year, she finished Haikyuu and was playing volleyball five days a week for two hours every day.

She was committed. She found "her sport."

So, in eighth grade, she was ready to try out for a team. My little sister, who didn't know how to set a volleyball a year ago, was competing with girls who had spent over five years playing the game. I was so proud.

But she didn't make a team.

And that's when everyone who knew my sister (me included, I'm sad to say) thought she was finally going to quit volleyball.

But you know what? She didn't.

She took the rejection and the negativity and used it as fuel to keep playing.

She kept on playing volleyball for hours every single day. She tried sand volleyball and did workouts and weight-lifting on top of her normal practices to help her get stronger.

Over the summer, she went to Dartmouth and Harvard to do two-week volleyball intensives.

And then in ninth grade, when she went back to volleyball tryouts, she beat out all of her friends who had been playing volleyball since elementary school and she was chosen to be on the best travel team in Austin.

I want to tell you this story partly because I’m just really proud of my sister. But also, there’s a deeper meta lesson here.

### How To Constructively “Follow Your Passion”

Teenagers are often told to “follow their passions.”

This is pretty useless advice for two main reasons:

1. What does “follow your passion” even mean?
2. A lot of teenagers don’t think that the things they like have a true purpose or have the potential to lead to a good career or future.

But we can all agree that it’s important for teens to spend time on the things that are meaningful to them. So how can we fix this problem?

First, let’s redefine “passion.”

Passion is not a *thing*. It’s not a destination or a place you can go find.

Passion, at its core, is *energy.* It’s *emotion.*

When people are passionate about something, they are *energized* by it.

So, instead of telling kids that passion is a mysterious thing that they have to find, ask them what energizes them. What makes them break into a brilliant smile or makes them buzz with excitement?

Make passion accessible.

*Okay, Austin. So “passion” is just energy. But kids need direction and goals so they can make money and be successful in life. How do they find their “thing?”*

If your teen is coming up blank when they’re asked what they like, have them try this straightforward time-tracking exercise:

At the end of every day during the week, have your kid block out how they spent their time.

I promise: there is something(s) in your kid’s life that energizes them. There’s something(s) that they spend hours every day doing (like my sister with her Haikyuu videos).

Every teen has a “passion.” They just don’t realize it yet. To see it, they have to be able to identify where they are putting in energy, and what’s giving them energy back.

Maybe it’s programming and science or maybe it’s watching YouTube videos.

Both have value.

I’m serious: [Mr. Beast](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrBeast6000/videos) gained over *100 million* subscribers on YouTube because he spent all of his time on YouTube and became an expert on making good videos.

But it can be hard to see the value of “just watching YouTube” at first–which is why kids need a good foundation, so they can see how the places they’re spending time in might reap rewards down the road.

The Ikigai framework is *extremely* helpful for transforming passions into valuable outputs.

The idea is to find the intersection between what they love, what they’re good at, what the world needs, and what they can be paid for.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG3EUMArrU0) does a fantastic job outlining the Ikigai framework.

Creating this Venn diagram is what helped me come up with my Masterpiece (for those of you who are new: my big high school project at [Alpha](https://alphahigh.school/)).

* I love reading and writing. I spend at least two hours every day reading books and writing short stories or poems.
* I’m excellent at using adaptive apps and other alternative educational techniques.
* The world needs the education system to be brought to the 21st century.
* I can be paid for writing online.

With these four facts, the idea for this newsletter formed.

I wanted to utilize the energy that writing gives me and my knowledge of alternative education to write high-quality pieces on radical education that people would be willing to pay for.

And so, I dove in and started this newsletter.

All that to say: the most important thing you can do is have your kid just start diving in and *doing something.*

But, why?

Why is this entire idea–having high schoolers find their passion–so important?

Well, practically, if you spend time on something, you’ll become good at it. If you start in high school, you’ll have enough time to become great.

And more importantly, if teens find what they’re passionate about now, it will lead them to the best career path for them.

But more big-picture, *kids need to give life its own energy*. They need to revitalize and reenergize their lives by spending their time on what matters to them.

Steve Jobs said it best:

> “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”

### Scholar’s Sources: My Favorite Resources On Finding A Purpose

Even within the seemingly-simple subsection of “what do you like” or “what are you good at,” most teenagers find themselves completely lost and with no real sense of direction on how to answer those questions. They can also fall into the trap of “what I like can’t get me a job.”

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9VdqvYDSc) does a fantastic job of breaking down 11 natural inclinations (called “abilities”) with three sections in each: definition of the ability, ways to identify the ability in a person, and potential jobs that can come from the ability.

Here are the 11 abilities:

- Musical

- Natural

- Movement

- Interpersonal

- Intrapersonal

- Logical

- Linguistic

- Digital

- Visual

- Teaching

- Spiritual

As a whole, this video sets up a clear and manageable framework for teenagers to use when deciding what skills they might try out.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3RKIyU4GuU) does an absolutely brilliant job of explaining why “find your passion” is terrible advice. The overall summary of the message is that “passion” isn’t something to be found. Instead, passion is a feeling; it’s energy. Instead of “finding your passion,” the video urges you to “find your energy.”

This is an absolutely critical message for teenagers. Most teens are unhappy because they feel like they haven’t found their passion or aren’t able to spend time on their passion because of their academic commitments.

Instead, if we teach teens to find ways to bring energy and life to the things they are doing, since passion is energy, their lives will be more passionate and meaningful to them.

Encourage them to do things that energize them: to take a walk around the neighborhood before writing their essay or to bake some cookies before they start their math homework. Bring more energy into their lives.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeoVDeUhrms) is absolutely a must watch for *every single teenager*.

Despite all of the self-help novels and YouTube videos and tweets telling us to “follow our passion,” most of us have no idea where to start.

*How do I know what I’m passionate about?*

*How do I follow my passion?*

*How do I pick the right passion?*

This video gives clear, concrete steps to answering these questions.

The core message is that simply starting a project or trying out a passion is the best thing your teen can do. Just trying out different activities or things that they might like will help them figure out what it is that they truly want to spend their time on.

Encourage your teen to just start working on a small project that they think they might enjoy.
