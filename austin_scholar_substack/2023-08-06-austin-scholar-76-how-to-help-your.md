### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s Anecdote: How I learned to accept feedback from my dad
2. How to help your kid get better at receiving feedback
3. Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been reading and watching this week

My dad’s birthday was yesterday, so I really want to take the beginning of this newsletter to celebrate him.

Although he’s only the second funniest person I know (my sister would give me disappointed eyes if I said otherwise), he always knows how to make me laugh and smile. Dad: you make everyone you meet feel empowered–like they can do anything. I can only hope to have the same impact on the people around me as you. I love you so much and am so lucky that you’re my dad <3

### Austin’s Anecdote: How I learned to accept feedback from my dad

For years, all I’ve wanted was to make my dad proud of me. I worked to be the smartest and hardest-working person I could be, to prove to him that I was good enough. Recently, I’ve been able to work on the “[have to be perfect to be good enough](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-44-from-perfectionist)” thing, but the desire for my dad to be proud of me hasn’t gone away, and I don’t think it ever will.

This used to make accepting feedback from him impossible.

I saw every critique or revision as a sign that I wasn’t good enough–that he wasn’t proud of what I was capable of. Unfortunately for me, though, my dad’s love language is helping people get better–to reach their full potential. Which means that he loves to give feedback.

Of course, this led to a depressing cycle of him wanting to help me and me feeling attacked–which made him want to help even more, which made me feel even more attacked. Not great.

So, I talked to my lovely therapist about it, and she had a fantastic recommendation: set boundaries. It’s not that I disagreed with any of the feedback my dad was giving me–it was just hard to hear it from him. The natural solution, then, was just to create some separation between the feedback and him.

And y’all know how I love saying things in writing, so we set up a little system where if my dad wants to give me feedback on something I’ve done, he just has to write me a note and email it to me.

Surprisingly, this degree of separation was really all I needed to not feel hurt. It wasn’t a big change, but it really altered how we communicated. And, we made sure to do something fun together after the feedback was given, [like watching a new TV show or talking about baseball](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-70-how-to-intentionally). This way, our interaction didn’t end with the critiques; it ended with smiles and love.

### How to help your kid get better at receiving feedback

Of course, what my dad and I do won’t work perfectly for every family, so here are a few more ways to help teach your kid to receive feedback gracefully (especially when it’s from you):

1. Have them practice giving feedback to others (even you)

Encouraging your child to give feedback to others, including you, can make the process of giving and receiving feedback more familiar and less intimidating. For example, after a family dinner, you could ask your child to provide feedback on how the dinner went or what you could improve for next time. This not only helps them understand how feedback can be constructive and helpful, but also how to deliver it in a way that's kind and respectful.

It's also important to model receiving their feedback gracefully. Show them that it's okay to make mistakes and to learn from them. This can teach them that feedback isn't about criticism, but about growth and development.

2. Encourage them to seek out feedback from other adults

It can be incredibly important for your kid to hear feedback from adults other than their parents. School teachers, sports coaches, music tutors, or even trusted family friends are all great for this.

These people can offer a different perspective–and your kid might be more receptive to their feedback because it's not coming from you, who they probably feel is 'always' critiquing them. The lower stakes can also help them understand that feedback is a normal part of life and not something to be feared or avoided.

Encourage your child to ask for feedback from these adults and to take it in stride, perhaps even discussing it with you afterward so you can help them process and act on it in a positive way. Even just recommending to your kid that they ask their teacher for feedback after class on an assignment like an essay can be a great start.

3. Ask ChatGPT how to word your feedback

ChatGPT is the perfect wordsmith that can help you tailor your interaction with your kid, to meet both your needs and theirs.

Here is an example of what I mean:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PeZ7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42517a0b-bb1a-4d0a-aa79-0624891a064f_448x956.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PeZ7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42517a0b-bb1a-4d0a-aa79-0624891a064f_448x956.png)

The prompt: You are a parent to a [age] child. They [describe situation]. You are giving feedback to your child on how they can handle the situation better next time. Be kind and compassionate and ensure they won’t feel attacked by my words.

Remember, the goal isn’t to make your kid never feel sad or hurt when they receive disappointing feedback, but to help them become more open to feedback and recognize that it’s a tool for growth and improvement.

### Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been reading this week

1. [The Crying of Lot 49](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crying_of_Lot_49)

For my last week of Yale classes, I read *The Crying of Lot 49*, which is certainly a way to end the course with a bang. This novel is full of puzzles and confusion and disappointment–definitely something to read for all of the conspiracy theorists of the world.

2. [Succession](https://www.hbo.com/succession) and [Foundation](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/foundation/umc.cmc.5983fipzqbicvrve6jdfep4x3)

I watched both of these shows with my parents, and I have to say they are fantastic conversation starters. If you ever need some quality talking material, watch one episode from either show and spend some time analyzing the characters and the plot.

3. [Ethan Mollick and college essays](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1682258198374301697?s=20)

As my senior year gets closer and it becomes the time to apply to college (the Common App opened this week?!), I’ve spent a lot of time researching college essays–particularly how new AI technologies are going to fit into the entire application process. [Ethan Mollick is my favorite AI guy](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-75-summer-projects), so I definitely keep watch for his comments.

4. [Intelligent people like Taylor Swift](https://www.musicradar.com/news/intelligent-people-like-taylor-swift)

As a Swifty, this makes me very happy. And, since Taylor Swift is our family’s collective favorite artist (yes, my dad agrees, too), this bodes very well for us.

5. [Warren Buffet and becoming successful](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1685293755916591104?s=20)

I absolutely loved this tweet. I highly recommend going through this thought exercise with your kid (or just sending it to them) so they can really see the type of person they want to be.
