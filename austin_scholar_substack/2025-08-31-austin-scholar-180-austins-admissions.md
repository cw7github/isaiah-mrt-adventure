### **Hey, y'all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. Austin’s admissions guide for 2025
2. Scholar’s Sources: College application resources

Welcome to what I'm hoping will be the most practical, unique college admissions guide you'll read this year. As someone who just wrapped up freshman year at Stanford (and watched my younger sister navigate her own college applications this past year), I've definitely learned a lot since I wrote [last year’s](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-112-my-complete-resource) college admissions guide. I build off of that edition in this one, though, so read last year’s before this one if you haven’t already.

I'm sharing everything I wish I knew when I was applying to colleges, plus insights from my Stanford classmates who've been incredibly generous in sharing their real admissions journeys with y'all. This newsletter will look a little different than normal because I’m using a lot of quotes from my friends, so I’d love feedback from y’all on this format. I hope you enjoy it!

### Austin’s admissions guide for 2025

A quick recap from last year: getting into top universities isn't actually about having perfect grades, 15 AP classes, and being captain of three sports teams. Students who follow that "well-rounded" path have less than a 3% admission rate to places like Stanford and Harvard. But students who master what I call the "75% strategy" – achieving Olympic-level excellence (basically, being one of the best in the world) in one specific area – have success rates closer to, you guessed it, 75%.

I wrote last year’s guide soon after getting accepted into Stanford. Since then, through my freshman year, I interviewed dozens of classmates about their admissions journeys. I've incorporated a lot of their advice, and the lessons I learned from them, into this new version of the guide.

My roommate Anya Parasher, who founded a mental health program that was put in schools across New Mexico, said: "I'd stress that your passion projects in high school don't have to align directly with what you plan to study in the future (e.g. they don’t have to be an academic topic)... I also encourage students not to choose projects just because they think the final product will look good on a résumé. Instead, focus on what truly motivates you and where you can have the most impact."

Another Stanford classmate, Mark Leschinsky, who started a film festival and impacted almost 500,000 students globally, shared this insight: "Success often requires trial and error... By identifying a problem I was deeply familiar with, I was able to create a solution that resonated with others." The key wasn't that he was naturally gifted at filmmaking – it was that he identified a real problem (film festival application costs) and persistently worked to solve it.

What's fascinating is that every single successful Stanford student I talked to had this pattern: they found something they genuinely cared about, got obsessively good at it, and created measurable impact. Not because they thought it would look good on applications, but because they couldn't stop themselves from working on it. It was through obsession and expertise that they were able to solve problems that most people didn’t know existed, achieve mind-blowing goals, and truly become Olympic-level in their domain.

Based on my research and conversations with Stanford classmates, here's the framework that actually works to help you on this path:

**Step 1: find your niche.** If you don’t know where to start on a project, don't ask yourself "What am I passionate about?" Instead ask: "What problem do I see in my community that I can't stop thinking about?" Mark wasn't passionate about festivals – he was frustrated by expensive submission fees. That frustration became his niche.

**Step 2: Set big goals.** Next, you have to create your Olympic-level goal. This means that you have to create seemingly-impossible measurable outcomes for your project. Don't just "volunteer at a hospital" – start a program that trains 100,000+ teenage volunteers in patient communication skills. Don't just "tutor students" – develop a systematic approach that helps struggling students improve their grades by an average of 15+ points that is implemented in all public school districts in New York City. Create a goal that you don’t know how to accomplish, but one that you wouldn’t mind spending hours every day after school working on solving.

This is why genuine interest and passion is important. One of my good friends, Sloane, loves creating TikTok videos and decided she wanted to be a positive force and empower teenage girls on the platform. Thus far, she’s grown to 2.2 million TikTok followers and has gotten hundreds of thousands of comments from girls telling her that she has transformed their self-confidence and that they learned how to love themselves because of her videos.

Sloane saw a problem that she genuinely cared about and wanted to fix and has spent thousands of hours working on it. If she’d forced herself to pick a project that she thought would “look good on her résumé”, she wouldn’t have the success that she does today.

**Step 3: Put in the hours.** What comes next is simple in words, but incredibly difficult in action. You must put in the hours to become a true expert in your field, build your [BrainLift](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-171-my-summer-project) (build your database of information and resources), start posting on social media to gain recognition in your field from experts, use that recognition to meet your heroes and gain resources for your project, and take whatever next steps are necessary to build your product, program, or deliverable. This doesn’t happen at once; it takes years of hard work. You might not even reach your goal (I didn’t!) but the progress that you make, passion you show, growth you embody, and experiences you have will be irresistible to admissions officers.

**Step 4: Tell your story.** Once it’s time to start crafting your admissions essays, you’ve already done all of the hard work. This is the place where you showcase your journey – the problem you identified, the passion you felt, the mistakes and growth you experienced along the way, the ways your perspective changed, and your plans for the future. Use your application to showcase how your project changed you and what this change will allow you to do as you strike out towards your next goals.

You will be able to write an essay that no one – not even an AI – could write, because you will have developed a unique perspective on the world that no one could ever replicate. (I have a lot more that I could get into regarding the Personal Statement itself, so please reach out to me if you’d like personalized advice or more specific information to help write it.)

Your activities list will tell the story of how your project evolved and the milestones you achieved (e.g. I had my newsletter itself (my overall project), Learn and Earn (the educational nonprofit I co-founded), my X Space that got a total of 10,000 listeners, and the writing curriculum I developed with David Perell as a few of my activities to show the different ways my project impacted the world).

I would also get one additional letter of recommendation from someone involved in your project (I had David Perell write mine) to showcase that experts in your field view you as an expert, too.

Provide links to your project and any impressive statistics about your accomplishments in the Additional Information section (which is now 300 words, as opposed to the previous 650 word limit).

Use supplemental essays and the rest of your activities list to show that you are a multi-faceted human being (I talked about ice skating, volunteering with my mom, my Equation-Based Writing program, and fantasy books that I liked).

While your extracurriculars are the most important part of your application, your general academics matter quite a lot, too.

For elite universities, a high GPA and SAT or ACT score, along with several AP or IB courses is the baseline, not a differentiator. I understand that with an eight-hour school day and hours of additional homework, it can seem like academics must be the most important signal for colleges. But it’s not.

I guarantee that a top university would rather see you get a B in a class than turn down a great opportunity for your project. Your Olympic-level project will be what differentiates you, so make sure that’s what you’re prioritizing.

That being said, you need to have good grades and test scores overall so that the schools know that you can succeed in their classes. Prioritize the project, but put a lot of emphasis on your grades too.

With 2 Hour Learning and Alpha School, I didn’t have a problem dividing my time. My academics were done in the morning, and I had all afternoon and after school to work on my project. So I’m sorry to say that there’s not a ton of experiential advice I can give you to help navigate this challenge.

This is another reason why it’s so important you pick a project you genuinely enjoy working on. If you have school work that you don’t like *and* a project you don’t like, you’re very likely to get burnt out. However, if your project invigorates you, it will balance the drudgery of boring classes and endless tests.

All of that being said, here are my general rules for academics to meet the basic requirements for top universities:

* At least three 5s on hard AP or IB classes (e.g. not Human Geography)
* 1500+ SAT score (preferably 1550+)
* Primarily As on your transcript
* Evidence that you voluntarily take a hard course load (to show that you challenge yourself academically)

As many of you know, I got a 1600 on the SAT and wrote a [newsletter](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-94-how-i-got-a-1600) with my advice for how to do the same. I highly recommend reading that a couple of weeks before taking the exam.

I know this all sounds like a lot (trust me, I was extremely overwhelmed when I realized everything that I had to do to get into my dream universities), so it’s important to remember this advice from my Stanford classmate Alena: "My parents really just pushed me to do my best in all aspects of life, telling me to try my hardest no matter what... striking that precarious balance between instilling a sense of discipline and minimizing undue stress is really important."

Yes, it’s important to do your best and work hard, but with teenagers particularly, it’s also important to focus on managing stress.

I found DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) really helpful during college applications (and I still use them at Stanford!). Here are a few of my favorites:

**The TIPP technique:** When you feel like you’re spiraling about your future or stuck in your head, use the TIPP technique. The goal of TIPP is to change your body’s physical chemistry – heart rate, temperature, and breathing – in order to calm down during stressful situations. Change your **t**emperature by holding ice or using a heating pad, do some **i**ntense exercise like running or biking, practice a form of **p**aced breathing such as box breathing (in for 4, hold for 4, out for 4, hold for 4), or practice **p**rogressive muscle relaxation by tensing each muscle group individually for five seconds then releasing.

**Radical acceptance:** For managing rejection (because it happens to everyone – it did to me, too), practice Radical Acceptance. Acknowledge the disappointment while focusing on what you can control moving forward. I love to say the Serenity Prayer (God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference) and will consult the graphic on [this website](https://hopeway.org/blog/radical-acceptance) if I’m struggling with the skill.

**Make lists and problem solve:** When you’re extremely overwhelmed and don’t know what you should do next, make a list and problem solve. Here’s an example situation: I have too much anxiety getting my grade back from a test and my homework for me to focus on my task and my head is pounding so I can’t read the article on my laptop. Let’s make a list of problems and figure out solutions:

* My head hurts. *Take Advil and get an ice pack.*
* I have too much anxiety about my grade. *I cannot do anything about this test score right now, so I will practice radical acceptance.*
* I need to finish reading the article on my laptop before class but my head hurts too much. *Use AI text-to-voice.*
* I still have three math worksheets to finish and it’s already 11:00pm. *Take a five minute break to dramatically lip sync to Hamilton to clear my mind before working on the worksheets. Take a few extra minutes after to set clothes out for tomorrow, get my backpack ready, pack breakfast, and braid my hair so that I can sleep in a couple of extra minutes.*

I’m sure this skill has an official name, but this is just something I started doing to help with my anxiety. Writing down each problem and solving each one to the best of my ability is a fantastic way to calm myself down when I get overwhelmed.

Research by David Yeager shows that teenagers (really all young people ages 10-25) are neurobiologically wired to care about respect and social contribution. It helps to think about your portfolio-building process through that lens. Frame your journey as developing capabilities to contribute meaningfully to society, not just checking boxes for admissions officers. This is another reason that it’s important to be genuinely interested and excited about your problem and project: so you feel like you’re doing something useful for the world.

To wrap it all up, I’ll use a quote from my Stanford friend Ella Lan, who's done insane research on AI and worked with Jane Street and Meta (she literally coded for Instagram this summer!?): "When you truly enjoy the things you're doing, it allows you to do them better, and it makes you a happier person overall... my advice is to find something meaningful—something you enjoy and feel motivated to spend more time on."

That's the real secret. The students who get into top schools aren't necessarily the smartest or most academically accomplished – they're the ones who found something they couldn't stop working on and developed genuine expertise through obsessive curiosity.

The college admissions process is intense, but it's also an incredible opportunity to develop capabilities that will serve you for life. The research skills, project management experience, and self-advocacy you'll develop are worth as much as any acceptance letter (and they’re worth something in and of themselves even if you don’t want an acceptance letter at all).

Remember: colleges don't just want students who can succeed in their classes – they want people who will contribute meaningfully to society after graduation. When you focus on developing real expertise and creating authentic impact, the admissions outcomes tend to take care of themselves.

### Scholar’s Sources: College Application Resources

For SAT help, I would use Math Academy [SAT Foundations](https://www.mathacademy.com/courses/sat-math-fundamentals) (which is hopefully obvious [at this point](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-130-how-and-why-to)) and the new [SAT Leveling](https://satleveling.com/) app. SAT Leveling is an app created by the [TimeBack team](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-177-the-alpha-app) and is therefore backed by learning science. SAT Leveling has a moneyback guarantee and is officially open for Early Access! I highly recommend that y’all sign up your high schoolers for SAT Leveling to help them improve their SAT scores.

For all of your ambitious high schoolers who don’t have access to the Alpha program, sign up for [Prequel](https://www.joinprequel.com/). This program will help your kid kickstart and build their Olympic-level project, using the same workshops and resources that the in-person Alpha students do. As the Prequel program is composed of students who don’t go to Alpha, all of them (along with the coaches!) will have fantastic advice for managing school, grades, and the project.

Finally, for the rest of your extracurriculars, use the [CollegeVine simulation tool](https://www.collegevine.com/) to explore what extracurricular activities you should be doing throughout high school to boost your chances of getting into your dream universities. A good rule of thumb is to have one 1A level (your Olympic-level project) and two 2A/B levels that relate to your 1A project. As I talked a lot about previously, the more cohesive your application is, the better. Here are a few examples of projects that rank well on the CollegeVine simulation:

* For internships: After you’ve gained credibility through growing your audience, use your platform to reach out to experts directly about an internship.
* For summer programs: Look for summer programs from a reputable entity that are already known for impressing colleges. Make sure the program aligns with your Olympic-level project.
* For community service: The most impressive community service extracurriculars are the ones where you start your own initiative (minimum 100 participants). Regular community service is valuable in life, but not on your college application.
* For school clubs: Hold a leadership position and bring your club to the national level in its field. Again, only participate in the clubs that relate to your theme.
