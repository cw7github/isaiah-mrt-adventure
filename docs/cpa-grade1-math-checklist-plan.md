# CPA Grade 1 Math “I Can” Checklist → Lesson Content Plan

**Source of truth for scope:** `Gr._1_Mathematics_I_Can_Checklist_CPA_23-24.pdf`  
**Reference only:** external skill taxonomies (IXL, etc.) may help with organization, but are not the target.

This plan translates Cabrillo Point Academy’s Grade 1 Math checklist into an app-friendly **scope + sequence** using the “MRT lines + stations” model:

- **Skills stay atomic** for mastery/analytics (each checklist standard is trackable).
- **Stations bundle 3–8 related skills** (one core + adjacent variants + 1–2 review).
- **One job per screen** (each page targets one behavior/model).
- **Concrete → pictorial → abstract** on every new concept (manipulatives first, then pictures, then equations).
- **Word problems are audio-first**: minimize reading load; always speak the problem; show a picture model.

## 1) Content Architecture (How We Cover the Checklist)

### 1.1 Lines (Big strands)

Organize lines by the checklist domains so the UI scales and progress feels coherent:

- **Operations Line (OA):** addition/subtraction concepts, strategies, equations, fact fluency.
- **Base Ten Line (NBT):** counting to 120, tens/ones, comparing, add within 100, tens shifts.
- **Measurement & Data Line (MD):** length, time, represent & interpret data.
- **Shapes Line (G):** attributes, build/draw, compose shapes, partition into halves/fourths.
- **Review / Mixed Mastery Line:** spiral review across all lines with short sprints.

### 1.2 Skill checklists inside stations

Each station shows a compact checklist (3–8 dots). Each dot maps to one atomic checklist item (or a tightly scoped sub-skill when a checklist item contains multiple behaviors).

For large practice sets (especially **fact fluency within 20**), use **bands**:
- Show **3–6 dots** (“Band 1”, “Band 2”…), where each band is a focused fact family range (e.g., +0/+1, doubles, make‑10, near‑doubles).
- Still track **problem-level mastery under the hood**.
- Require “band completion” to mean consistent performance (e.g., ≥80% over a sufficiently large item pool).

### 1.3 Mastery rules (default)

- **Per-skill mastery:** 12 items, ≥80% correct overall, ≥60% first-try correct.
- **Model requirement:** for new skills, require success on **at least two representations** (e.g., ten frame + equation) before marking mastered.
- **Review spacing:** a mastered skill must reappear in Review/Mixed stations at least 3 times over 2–4 weeks.

### 1.4 Coverage modes (what “meets the checklist” means in this app)

Most Grade 1 math standards are app-friendly, but a few are better with real objects. Use these modes:

- **Mode A — Auto-graded (default):** student demonstrates on-screen and app grades reliably (most OA/NBT/MD/G).
- **Mode B — App-assisted + parent check:** app provides prompts; student uses real objects/paper; parent confirms (optional extensions for measuring with household objects, building 3D shapes).
- **Mode C — Offline recommended:** optional prompts only; primarily off-screen (rare for Grade 1 math).

---

## 2) Required Screen Types (Minimum set to meet the checklist well)

### 2.1 Reuse (already in app)
- **3-choice multiple choice** (good for comparisons, true/false, identify model).
- **Audio prompts + simple tap interactions** (good for counting sequences).

### 2.2 Add (high priority for math)
- **Manipulatives board:** drag counters; optional ten-frame mode; optional number-bond circles.
- **Number line (0–20 / 0–120):** hop forward/back; show “counting on/back” as jumps.
- **Equation builder:** drag digits/operators/blank; supports “missing number.”
- **Base-ten blocks:** tens rods + ones cubes; supports “make a ten” and regroup visuals.
- **Sort (2–3 bins):** shapes by attributes; compare lengths; group data categories.

### 2.3 Add (nice-to-have, improves fidelity)
- **Clock tool:** set/read hour and half-hour (analog; optional digital).
- **Graph tool:** build a picture graph/bar graph; then answer questions.
- **Shape builder:** compose shapes from pieces; partition shapes into equal parts.

## 5) Priority Emphasis (What matters most for Grade 1 outcomes)

Even while covering the whole checklist, prioritize time and item volume on:

1. **Word problems with models** (OA.A.1/A.2): act-it-out → draw-it → equation.
2. **Place value (tens/ones)** (NBT.B.2/B.3/B.5): always represent before comparing.
3. **Add within 100 with meaning** (NBT.C.4): base-ten blocks first; regroup as “make a new ten.”
4. **Fluency within 20 without memorization-only** (OA.C.6): require occasional model use to prevent blind guessing.

---

## 6) “Definition of Done” for new stations (Checklist-aligned QA)

For each station:
- Every checklist skill has a clear **success criterion** (what counts as mastery).
- Item pool prevents memorization (≥ 80 unique items for high-frequency stations like O7; ≥ 40 elsewhere).
- Word problems are **TTS-safe** and have prebuilt audio for all learner-facing strings.
- Each new concept includes at least **two representations** (manipulative/picture + equation) before mastery.
- Distractors are “near misses” that reflect common confusions (e.g., mixing up tens/ones, reversing comparison signs).
- Review hooks: newly mastered skills schedule into Review/Mixed stations automatically.
