# Legacy: Food Station Scene Backgrounds

This folder contains a deprecated plan for generating **per-page** backgrounds into `assets/scenes/` for early “food station” story content.

## Current scene system

The current app uses **per-station** scene images:

- ELA: `assets/station_scenes/`
- Math: `assets/math_station_scenes/`

Start here for the current workflow:
- `docs/reference/scenes-quick-start.md`
- `docs/reference/how-to-use-scenes.md`

The legacy entry point is `README_SCENES.md`.
