# Legacy Docs

This folder contains older documentation that may be useful for historical context, but is **not the current “how to”** for the live app.

If you’re looking for the current workflows, start with:
- `docs/README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

## What’s in here

- `docs/legacy/audio-manifest-system/` — an older audio-manifest + `assets/audio/` pipeline (the current app uses `assets/tts/` + `speak()`).
- `docs/legacy/food-station-scenes/` — deprecated per-page `assets/scenes/` background approach for the early “food stations” (kept for historical reference).
- `docs/legacy/content-pack-rendering-engine/` — abandoned “copy-paste rendering engine” approach (the current app loads JSON packs via `station-selection.js`).
- `docs/legacy/station-selection/` — older station-selection UI docs (superseded by `docs/guides/station-selection.md`).
- `docs/legacy/read-page/` — older read-page component docs (superseded by `docs/guides/read-page.md`).
- `docs/legacy/implementation-guides/` — historical integration notes/checklists from earlier phases.
- `docs/legacy/directory-structure.txt` — snapshot of an older repo layout.
- Other legacy guides may be moved here over time when the implementation is fully merged into `index.html`.
