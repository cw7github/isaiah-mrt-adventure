## DETAILED FINDINGS BY CATEGORY

### 1. PHONICS SKILLS (Reading Foundations)

#### EXCELLENT SKILLS:
- **blend-sounds** - Clear phonics instruction, asks students to blend letter sounds
- **digraph-find** - Teaches SH/CH/TH patterns effectively
- **digraph-choose** - Applies digraph knowledge with word completion
- **vowel-team-** series (ee, ea, ai, etc.) - Comprehensive vowel pattern coverage
- **r-controlled-** series (ar, er, ir, or, ur) - Good r-controlled vowel practice
- **silent-e** - Clear silent e instruction
- **phoneme-change-first/last/vowel** - Excellent phonemic awareness

#### GOOD SKILLS:
- **rhyming-choose/odd/complete** - Good rhyme work, varied approaches
- **short-vowel-fill** - Teaches CVC patterns
- **syllables-count/which** - Good syllable awareness

#### NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:
- **consonant-or-vowel** - Too basic for practice (just identifying vowel/consonant)
  - ISSUE: No reading/decoding involved
  - FIX: Should show word and ask which letters are vowels

- **vowels-letter** - Just picking a vowel from list
  - ISSUE: Not contextual enough
  - FIX: Should identify vowels within words

- **start-letter/end-letter** - Find word starting/ending with letter
  - ISSUE: Prompts are fine but limited educational value
  - FIX: OK as-is for Level 1, but could add phoneme emphasis

- **first-sound/last-sound** - Find first/last letter in a word
  - ISSUE: Same as start/end-letter essentially
  - FIX: Could combine or differentiate (sound vs letter)

#### RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Distinguish "sound" vs "letter" more clearly
2. Add more blending practice with different word types
3. Consider adding word family practice (-at, -ig, -ot families)

## CONCLUSION

The skill practice system is **educationally sound and well-implemented**. The main issues are:
- Some question banks are too small (need 10+ items minimum)
- Preposition skill has incorrect distractors
- Some comprehension distractors are too absurd (too easy)
- Could expand sight word and affix coverage

The system shows strong understanding of early literacy instruction and provides good scaffolding across difficulty levels. With the recommended improvements, this would be an **A+ educational resource**.
