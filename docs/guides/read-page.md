# Read Page Component

Read pages are the core “reading” screens (large text, tappable words, optional read-aloud with word highlighting).

## Key files

- UI component JS: `read-page.js`
- Component styles: `read-page.css`
- App integration + narration: `index.html`

## What a read page supports

- Big, readable sentence text
- Tap a word to hear it
- “Read All” / “Read to Me” playback with word highlighting (when word timings exist)
- Sight-word focus styling (and optional sight-word gating)
