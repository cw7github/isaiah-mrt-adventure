# THE GROWTH TOWER

**A Living Building Where Plants Tell Stories**

An educational Grade 1 app teaching the plant life cycle through an organic, interactive adventure inspired by William Morris botanical patterns and Studio Ghibli animation aesthetics.

---

## QUICK START

Open `/apps/growth-tower/index.html` in a web browser. The app is fully self-contained and requires no build process or server.

---

## CONCEPT

The Growth Tower is a magical building where a giant vine serves as the elevator, carrying you through five floors that represent stages of plant growth. Each floor teaches science concepts while a storytelling sunflower shares its journey from seed to bloom.

---

## THE 5 FLOORS

1. **SEED FLOOR** - Underground germination (🌱)
2. **ROOT FLOOR** - Root systems and water absorption (🌾)
3. **STEM FLOOR** - Breaking through soil (🌿)
4. **LEAF FLOOR** - Photosynthesis and growth (🍃)
5. **FLOWER FLOOR** - Blooming and pollination (🌻)

**BONUS**: Sky Garden - Rooftop celebration space!
