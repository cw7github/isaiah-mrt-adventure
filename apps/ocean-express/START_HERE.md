## What You'll See

### At the Surface
A beautiful Victorian brass bathysphere waiting at the pier. The porthole gleams with underwater light.

### Inside the Bathysphere
- **Left Side**: Depth and pressure gauges with brass frames
- **Center**: Large porthole window showing the ocean
- **Right Side**: Brass descent lever to pull
- **Everywhere**: Bubbles rising, creatures swimming by

### As You Descend
The ocean changes from bright blue (sunlight) → purple twilight → pitch black darkness. Watch creatures get stranger as you go deeper!

### The Journey
1. **Sunlight Zone** (200m) - Dolphins and tropical fish
2. **Twilight Zone** (1000m) - Glowing jellyfish
3. **Midnight Zone** (4000m) - The anglerfish with its lantern!

## For Isaiah

Hey Isaiah! You're about to become a deep-sea explorer.

You'll ride in a special submarine called a bathysphere—it's like an elevator that goes down into the ocean instead of up a building!

Watch what happens to the gauges as you go deeper. The depth needle spins around, and the pressure bar fills up. That's because water gets heavier the deeper you go!

When you reach the darkest part of the ocean, you'll meet a very special fish called an anglerfish. It has a glowing light on its head like a lantern! Read the story carefully—then you'll answer a question about what you learned.

Have fun exploring the ocean floor!

## The Science You'll Learn

### Ocean Zones
The ocean is divided into layers, just like a cake! Each layer has different animals and different amounts of light.

### Bioluminescence
Some deep-sea creatures make their own light! This is called bioluminescence (say: "bye-oh-loo-min-ESS-ence"). It's like having a built-in flashlight.

### Pressure
The deeper you go, the more water is pressing down on you. This is called pressure. The gauges in the bathysphere help you measure it!

### Adaptations
Animals that live in the deep ocean have special features to help them survive. The anglerfish's glowing lure is an adaptation for hunting in the dark.
